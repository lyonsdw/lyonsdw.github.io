  <title>Complex Numbers</title>
  <introduction>

    <!--
    <p>
    It is common to introduce the complex numbers as the set of elements
    of the form <m>a+bi</m>, where <m>a,b</m> are real, and <m>i</m> is a quantity
    whose square is <m>-1</m>. The advantage of this approach is the familiar
    look of addition and multiplication operations. In these notes, we
    adopt a different approach, where the definitions of complex
    operations come from a geometric viewpoint. This approach is neither
    more nor less rigorous that the standard one mentioned
    above. Rather, it is tailored to establish the basic properties of
    complex numbers needed most for introductory courses in mathematics
    and physics, where geometric properties play an important
    role. Rigorous construction of the real and complex numbers appears
    in upper level mathematics courses.

    The set of complex numbers, denoted <m>\C</m>, is in one-to-one
correspondence with the 2-dimensional real plane <m>\R^2</m>. We will write
<m>z\leftrightarrow (x,y)</m> to denote that the complex number <m>z</m>
    corresponds to the ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m> of real numbers.

    <title>Real and imaginary parts</title>

    <p>
Given a complex number <m>z</m> corresponding to the point <m>(x,y)</m>
in <m>\R^2</m>, we say that <m>x</m> is the <term>real part</term>
of <m>z</m> and that <m>y</m> is the <term>imaginary part</term> of
<m>z</m>, denoted <m>\re(z)=x</m> and
<m>\im(z)=y</m>. The complex numbers contain the real numbers <m>\R</m> as a
subset. The real number <m>x</m>, which is also the complex number <m>x</m>,
corresponds to the ordered pair <m>(x,0)</m>, The complex number <m>i</m>
corresponds to the ordered pair <m>(0,1)</m>. Here is a summary so far.

    <mrow>z \amp \leftrightarrow (\re(z),\im(z))
    </mrow>  
    <mrow>  x\in \R \amp \leftrightarrow (x,0)</mrow>
    <mrow>  i \amp \leftrightarrow (0,1)</mrow>
    </md>

    <title>Modulus and argument</title>

    <p>
    Given a complex number <m>z\leftrightarrow (x,y)</m>, let <m>(r,\theta)</m> be
polar coordinates for the point <m>(x,y)</m> such that <m>r\geq 0</m> and <m>\theta</m>
    is measured in radians. The <term>modulus</term> or
    <term>norm</term> of <m>z</m>, denoted <m>|z|</m>, is defined to be the polar
    coordinate <m>r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m> and the <term>argument</term> of <m>z</m>, denoted
<m>\arg{z}</m>, is the polar coordinate <m>\theta</m>, that is, the oriented
angle made by the 
real vector <m>(x,y)</m> with the positive real axis. In other words,
<m>(|z|,\arg{z})</m> are polar coordinates for the point <m>(x,y)</m>. Here is a summary.
    <men xml:id="normargdef">
      z\leftrightarrow (x,y) = \left(|z|\cos( \arg{z}),|z|\sin(\arg{z})\right) </men>

    <title>Addition and multiplication of complex numbers</title>

    <p>
    Given complex numbers <m>z\leftrightarrow (x,y)</m> and <m>z'\leftrightarrow
(x',y')</m>, the sum <m>z+z'</m> is defined by
    <men xml:id="complexadddef">
        z+z' \leftrightarrow (x+x',y+y').
    </men>
In other words, complex addition corresponds to real vector
addition. See Figure <xref ref="parallelogramlawfig"/>.
    <figure xml:id="parallelogramlawfig">
      <caption>Complex addition is vector addition
      </caption>
            <image width="60%" source="images/parallelogramlaw_clip.jpg"></image>
</figure>
The product <m>zz'</m> is defined by
<mdn>
  <mrow xml:id="complexmultdefnorm">|zz'| \amp = |z||z'|</mrow>  
  <mrow xml:id="complexmultdefarg">  \arg(zz') \amp = \arg{z}+\arg{z'}</mrow>  
  </mdn>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The interaction between complex addition and multiplication is expressed
    by the <term>distributive law</term>, which says that the following holds for
any complex <m>z,u,v</m>. See Figure <xref ref="distlawfig"/>. 
<men xml:id="distributivelaw">
  z(u+v) = zu+zv <!-- \hspace*{.2in}\mbox{({\bfit distributive law})}-->
</men>
<figure xml:id="distlawfig">
  <caption>The distributive law: multiplication by <m>z</m>
rotates the vectors <m>u</m>, <m>v</m>, and <m>u+v</m> by angle <m>\arg z</m> and scales by the
factor <m>|z|</m>. The sum of the rotated vectors <m>u,v</m> is the rotated sum vector.

Below are a number of relationships arising from the definitions of
complex addition and multiplication.
Let
<m>a,b,c,d</m> be real numbers and let <m>z,u,v</m> be complex
numbers. The following relationships
hold.
<fn>Equations <xref ref="addextends"/>, <xref ref="multextends"/>, and
  <xref ref="normextends"/> say
  that complex addition, multiplication, and norm <em>extend</em> the corresponding
operations on the reals. Equation <xref ref="multidentity"/> is expressed by saying 1 is the 
  <em>multiplicative identity</em>.</fn>
