    <exercise xml:id="hotelbilldoubleexer"><statement><p>Consider the following true-life situation.
	  <blockquote>
"I want to rent this room for the month of July," he said.  The clerk
wheezed.  He peered through the narrow slits of his bloodshot eyes,
glaring through the murk of the humid dusty darkness of the fleabag
lobby, and said, "for you<mdash/>a deal."  "How much?" said the big guy,
sweat trickling down his face, staining the collar of his dingy shirt
which didn't appear to have been washed in weeks.  Noticing the telltale
bulge of a revolver under the stranger's dirt-stained jacket, the clerk
replied, "First day<mdash/>one cent.  Second day<mdash/>two cents.  Third
day<mdash/>four.  Every day it doubles."  The stranger's face drew into a
knot as he scrutinized the greasy poker-faced clerk.  He said, "That's
nothin'.  What's the hitch?"

  <exercise xml:id="rabbitturtleraceexer"><title>Zeno's Paradox</title>
    <statement><p>The Greek philosopher Zeno (ca. 450BC)
considered the following motion problem.  A rabbit and a turtle agree to
run a race.  Displaying good sportsmanship, the rabbit, who can run
faster, gives the turtle a head start.  Zeno argued that the rabbit will
never catch the turtle, as follows.  To catch the turtle, the rabbit
must first travel from the starting point to the turtle's starting
point.  During this time, the turtle will advance.  Let's call the
turtle's new location point 2.  Now the rabbit must travel to point 2,
but during that time, the turtle advances to point 3.  And so on.  This
process defines an infinite sequence of distinct points.  Traveling from
each one to the next requires a positive amount of time.  Since an
infinite sum of positive numbers must be infinite, Zeno concludes that
the rabbit will never catch the turtle.  Of course, Zeno knew there must
be some flaw in this argument, but was unable to resolve the paradox
satisfactorily.
	  </p>

	  <p> Analyze Zeno's paradox under the following assumptions:
the rabbit travels at a constant speed of 5 feet per second; the turtle
travels at a constant speed of 2 feet per second; and the head start
distance is 10 feet.  Place coordinates on the race track with the
rabbit beginning at 0 and the turtle beginning at 10, with both running
in the positive direction.
	    <ol>
	      <li>Using high school algebra and the formula
		<me>(\text{distance}) = (\text{rate})(\text{time})</me>
find the location where the rabbit catches the turtle, and the time
elapsed from the beginning of the race to the point where the rabbit
catches the turtle.
	      </li>
	      <li>
Find the sequence of distances traveled by the rabbit from the
rabbit's starting point to the turtle's starting point, from there to
point 2, from point 2 to point 3, etc.		
	      </li>
	      <li>Find the sequence of times that elapse while the
rabbit traveled the distance intervals in the previous part.
	      </li>
	      <li>Use the theory of geometric sequences to resolve
Zeno's paradox by reconciling your findings in the previous steps of
this problem.

<subsection>     <title>Rational and Irrational Numbers</title>

  <p>A <term>rational number</term><idx><h>rational number</h></idx>
     is a number that can be written in the
    form <m>a/b</m>
    for some integers <m>a,b</m>. An <term>irrational
      number</term><idx><h>irrational number</h>
    </idx>
     is a
    real number that is not rational. The standard symbol for the set of
    rational numbers<idx><h>the set of rational numbers</h>
    </idx>
    is <m>\Q</m><notation><usage><m>\Q</m>
      </usage><description>the set of rational numbers</description>
    </notation>. In set notation, we have
    <me>\Q=\left\{\frac{a}{b}\colon a,b\in \Z, b\neq 0\right\}.</me>
    The following is a classic proof by contradiction that proves that
    at least one irrational number exists.
  </p>
  
<p>    <proposition xml:id="root2isirrat"><statement><p>The number <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.
	</p>
      </statement>
      <proof><p>
Suppose on the contrary that <m>\sqrt{2}=a/b</m> is rational, where <m>a,b</m> are
integers. We may assume both <m>a,b</m> are positive, and we may assume
that the fraction <m>a/b</m> is reduced, that is, that <m>a,b</m> have
no common factors other than 1. 
Squaring both sides of
<m>\sqrt{2}=a/b</m> and rearranging, we have <m>2b^2=a^2</m>. This says
that <m>a^2</m> is even, so it must be that <m>a</m> itself is even.
That means we can write <m>a=2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Substituting <m>2k</m>
for <m>a</m> in the equation <m>2b^2=a^2</m>, we
get <m>2b^2=(2k)^2=4k^2</m>, which simplifies to <m>b^2=2k^2</m>. Now we
see that <m>b^2</m> is even, so it must be that <m>b</m> is even. But this means that <m>a,b</m> are
both divisible by 2, which contradicts the assumption that <m>a,b</m>
share no common factors. We conclude that
 <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.
	</p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
  </p>

<exercise xml:id="parseroot2irratproofexer"><statement><p>Justify the statement in the proof above that
      says "so <m>a</m> itself must be even". Give a proof that uses the

<commentary component="instructor"><title>Instructor's solution for

  <p>
      <xref ref="evenoddexer"/> establishes that "an odd
      times an odd must be odd". Suppose now
      that <m>2|a^2</m>. If <m>a</m> is odd, then <m>a^2</m> is odd, but
      this contradicts that <m>2|a^2</m>. Thus it must be that <m>a</m>
      is even.
  </p>
  <p>
      For another proof, apply <xref ref="primedividesexer"/> to conclude
      that if <m>2|a^2</m>, then <m>2|a</m> as well. Alternatively,
      apply the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
      directly. Suppose <m>a=p_1p_2\ldots p_r</m> is a prime
      factorization of <m>a</m>. If <m>2|a^2</m>, then one of the
      primes <m>p_j</m> must be <m>2</m>, by uniqueness of prime
      factorization. Thus <m>2|a</m>.

  It turns out that irrational numbers are not rare or isolated among
  the real numbers; the rational numbers and irrational numbers are
  "everywhere" in the real line. The following proposition makes this
  statement precise.  Recall that an <em>open interval</em> of the real
  line is a set of the form
<me>(a,b)=\{x\in \R\colon a\lt x\lt b\}</me> for some real
numbers <m>a,b</m> with <m>a\lt b</m>.
We say that a
      subset <m>X\subseteq \R</m> is <term>dense</term> in <m>\R</m>
if every open interval  contains an element
      of <m>X</m>. 
  </p>

<p><proposition xml:id="ratsirratsdenseinrealsprop"><statement><p>The
	set <m>\Q</m> of rational numbers is dense in <m>\R</m>. 
	The set <m>\R\setminus \Q</m> of irrational numbers is dense in <m>\R</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    <proof>(This is an outline of the main points of the proof
      that <m>\Q</m> is dense in <m>\R</m>. In exercises below, you will complete the 
      details of the proof of the density of the rationals, and you will
      also prove the density of the irrationals.)
      Let <m>a,b</m> be
        given, with <m>a\lt b</m>, and
        let <m>\epsilon=b-a</m>. Choose an integer <m>n</m> large enough
        so that <m>1/n \lt \epsilon</m>. We claim that there is some
        integer multiple of <m>1/n</m> that lies between <m>a</m>
        and <m>b</m>, that is, there is some integer <m>m</m>
	such that <m>a\lt m/n \lt b</m>. If not, then there exist
        consecutive integer multiples <m>k/n,(k+1)/n</m> of <m>1/n</m>
        so that
	<me>k/n \leq a \lt b\leq (k+1)/n.</me> But then we would have
	<m>b-a\leq (k+1)/n -k/n = 1/n</m>, a contradiction. Thus we have
	shown that the open interval <m>(a,b)</m> contains a rational number.
	We conclude
	that <m>\Q</m> is dense in <m>\R</m>.

      <li>We start with the observation that, for any positive real
      number, there exists and integer that is larger. (This is called
      the Archimedean property of the real numbers, but we can be
	explicit by choosing <m>n=\lceil 1/\epsilon \rceil + 1</m>.) Thus, there exists
	some integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n\gt 1/\epsilon</m>. It

      <li>The situation is that we have 4 real numbers <m>R,S,T,U</m>

  have no common factors other than 1. So there must not be any prime
  factors of <m>b</m>. This implies <m>b=1</m>. This
  means <m>\sqrt{n}=a</m>, so <m>n=a^2</m> is a perfect square. We

  <p>
    Let <m>a,b</m> be given, with <m>a\lt b</m>. Using the fact that the
    rationals are dense in the reals, there is some rational number,
    say <m>m/n</m>, that lies in the
    interval <m>(a/\sqrt{2},b/\sqrt{2})</m>, that is, we have
    <me>a/\sqrt{2} \lt m/n \lt b/\sqrt{2}.</me> Multiplying through
    by <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, we have
    <me>a \lt m\sqrt{2}/n \lt b.</me> We need only show
    that <m>m\sqrt{2}/n</m> is irrational. If not, then there are
    integers <m>p,q</m> such that <m>m\sqrt{2}/n=p/q</m>, so that <m>\sqrt{2}=(pn)/(qm)</m>. But this is
    impossible, because <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational. Thus we conclude
    that the interval <m>(a,b)</m> contains an irrational number,
    namely <m>m\sqrt{2}/n</m>. Since the choice of <m>a,b</m> was
    arbitrary, we conclude that the irrationals are dense in the reals.
  </p>
  <p>Alternatively, you could follow the 4-step outline used to prove
    that the rationals are dense, making alterations to get to the
    point <m>a\lt m\sqrt{2}/n\lt b</m> for some
    integers <m>m,n</m>. Then you finish by showing <m>m\sqrt{2}/n</m>
    is irrational.

  <p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Because <m>20\cdot 18 = 360</m>, the answer is 18
	      steps. The first revisited point is <m>(1,0)</m>.
	    </li>
	    <li>For a brute force solution, we can list the steps in order:
 <m>27,54,71,98,\ldots</m>. We notice that 40 steps comes out to 3 trips
around the circle (<m>27\cdot 40 = 360\cdot 3</m>) and that this is the first
repeated position. So the answer is 40 steps, and the first revisited
 point is <m>(1,0)</m>. [Comment: there are more
insightful ways to solve this. You'll need a more general approach for
part f below.]
	    </li>
<li>    Suppose there is some number of steps, say <m>n</m>, at which we visit a
previously visited point. In those <m>n</m> steps, we would travel
<m>n\sqrt{2}</m> degrees. To say that this is a previously visited point, it
has to be true that we got to this point after some number, say <m>m</m>,
steps, with <m>m\lt n</m>. This means that <m>m\sqrt{2},n\sqrt{2}</m> would have to
be different by some whole number multiple of 360. So we would have
		   <me>n\sqrt{2}-m\sqrt{2}=360k</me>
for some integer <m>k</m>. Rearranging, we would have
 <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{360k}{n-m}</m>. But this is impossible by the result of
<xref ref="root2isirrat"/>. We conclude that there will {\em never} be a repeated
location when the step size is <m>\sqrt{2}</m> degrees.
		   </li>
<li>4 steps, first revisited point is <m>(1,0)</m>
</li>
<li>never repeats (similar argument as in part c)</li>
<li>
<p>  Let <m>\theta_0</m> be the step size, measured in revolutions. Suppose there
is some step count <m>n</m> at which we revisit, for the first time, a previously visited
  point (the step count starts at 0 at the starting
  point <m>(1,0)</m>).  To
say that this is a previously visited point, it has to be true that we
got to this point at some smaller step count <m>m\lt n</m>. We
  claim that <m>m</m> must be zero. Indeed, if <m>n'</m> is the step
  count on which we revisit a previously visited point, which we
  previously visited
  at <m>m'\lt n'</m> steps, then we would also have
  revisited the start point <m>(1,0)</m> at the step
  count <m>n'-m'</m>. By assumption, <m>n</m> is the <em>smallest</em>
  step count at which we revisit any point, so we must have <m>m=0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
  In <m>n</m> steps, we travel <m>n\theta_0 = k</m> revolutions,
  where <m>k \geq 1</m> is some integer.  Solving this last equation, we
  get <m>\theta=\frac{k}{n}</m>. Notice that, because <m>n,k</m> are the
  smallest possible integers in the fraction that
  represents <m>\theta_0</m>, it must be that the fraction <m>k/n</m> is
  reduced. Furthermore, if <m>\theta_0</m> is not rational, it must be
  that there is no point on the circle that is ever revisited in any
  number of steps.
</p>

<p>To summarize: steps of rational size <m>\theta_0=a/b</m> revolutions, with <m>a,b</m> reduced,
will first repeat after <m>b</m> steps, and the first repeat location is
<m>(1,0)</m>. This occurs after traveling exactly <m>a</m> times around the
circle. Steps of an irrational number of revolutions will never repeat.

Let <m>x=1.\overline{9}</m>. Then <m>10x= 19.\overline{9}</m>, and
<me>9x=10x-x=19.\overline{9}=1.\overline{9}=18,</me>
so we must have <m>x=2</m>. Another way to see why <m>1.\overline{9}=2</m> is to
use the sum formula for geometric series. We have
<me>.\overline{9} = .9 + .09 + .009 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty .9(.1)^n.</me>
This is a geometric series with initial term <m>.9</m> and common ratio <m>.1</m>,
and so it sums to the value <m>\displaystyle .9\left(\frac{1}{1-.1}\right)
= 1.</m>
Therefore we have <m>x=1.\overline{9}=1+.\overline{9} = 2</m>.

<commentary component="instructor"><title>Instructor's solution for

  <p>
Suppose that <m>x</m> has a repeating decimal representation
<me> x = X_kX_{k-1}\ldots X_2X_1.\overline{d_1d_2\ldots d_r}</me>
where the symbols <m>X_j</m> and <m>d_\ell</m> represent digits <m>0\ldots 9</m>.
Then we have the following.
<md><mrow>10^r \amp = X_kX_{k-1}\ldots X_2X_1d_1d_2\ldots d_r.\overline{d_1d_2\ldots
    d_r}\\</mrow>
  <mrow>(10^r-1)x \amp = 10^rx-x =X_kX_{k-1}\ldots X_2X_1d_1d_2\ldots d_r -
  X_kX_{k-1}\ldots X_2X_1</mrow>
</md>
which is a whole number, say <m>N</m>. Thus we have <m>x = N/(10^r-1)</m>, so we
see that <m>x</m> is a rational number. If the decimal for <m>x</m>
terminates, then we simply have <m>x=\frac{N}{10^r}</m> for the
integer <m>N=10^rx</m>, where <m>r</m> is the length of the finite block of
digits to the right of the decimal point.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, suppose that <m>x=a/b</m> is a rational number, where <m>a,b</m> are
whole numbers with <m>b\neq 0</m>. For the case when <m>a,b</m> are both positive,
long division produces a decimal representation for <m>x</m> through repeated
use of the division algorithm, where each stage produces a
remainder <m>r</m> in the range <m>0\leq r\lt b-1</m>. If at any stage
we obtain a remainder <m>r=0</m>, the decimal terminates. If we never
obtain a remainder <m>r=0</m>, then eventually we must obtain a
remainder that we have had before. At this point, the division process
begins a repeating block that repeats forever. If <m>x</m> is negative,
we apply the same argument to <m>|x|</m> to obtain a terminating or
repeating decimal, then <m>x</m> is represented by this decimal with a
minus sign in front of it.

      <m>\chi_B(x)=1</m>, which means that <m>x\in B</m>. This shows that every

      which means that <m>x\in A</m>. This shows that <m>B\subseteq A</m>. Having

      in <m>A\cap B</m>, so <m>\chi_{A\cap B}(x)=0</m>, and at least one of
      <m>\chi_A(x),\chi_B(x)</m> is zero, so <m>\chi_A(x)\chi_B(x)=0</m>. Thus,
      for all possible values of <m>x</m>, we have

<p>Let <m>(p,q)</m> be a point in <m>Q</m> with both <m>p,q</m>
	rational. First, write <m>p=\frac{s}{t},q=\frac{u}{v}</m> for some
	integers <m>s,t,u,v</m>. 
         Multiplying both sides of
	<me>\left(\frac{s}{t}\right)^2 +
	  \left(\frac{u}{v}\right)^2=1 </me>
	by <m>(tv)^2</m>, we get
	<me>(sv)^2+(tu)^2=(tv)^2.</me> Note that <m>(sv,tu,tv)</m> is a
	Pythagorean triple, and that <m>(sv/tv,tu/tv)=(p,q)</m>. If
	<m>(sv,tu,tv)</m> is not primitive, then we can remove all
	common factors and produce a primitive triple <m>(a,b,c)</m>
	such that <m>(a/c,b/c)=(p,q)</m>.
	</p>

      <p>Now suppose that there is another reduced Pythagorean
	triple <m>(d,e,f)</m> such that <m>(d/f,e/f)=(p,q)</m>. 
Then we have <m>a/c=d/f</m>. Rearranging, we have
	<m>af=dc</m>. Because <m>a,c</m> share no common factors
	(by <xref ref="pythripprimpairwisereduced"/> above), it must be that all the prime factors of <m>a</m> are also
prime factors of <m>d</m>, so we have <m>a|d</m>. Likewise, we have <m>c|f</m>. But the
same argument applies to show that <m>d|a</m> and <m>f|c</m>, so we have <m>a=d</m> and
<m>c=f</m>, and it follows that 
<m>(a,b,c)=(d,e,f)</m>. 
</p>


      <p>The above arguments show that the function <m>f\colon \{\text{primitive Pythagorean triples}\}\to
	  \{\text{rational points on } Q\}</m> given
	by <m>f(a,b,c)=(a/c,b/c)</m> is surjective (we showed that for
	every rational point <m>(p,q)</m> on <m>Q</m>, 
	there is at
	least one primitive Pythagorean triple <m>(a,b,c)</m> such
	that <m>f(a,b,c)=(p,q)</m>) and also injective (we showed there is
	at most one reduced Pythagorean triple in the preimage of <m>(p,q)</m>).
	We conclude that <m>f</m> is a one-to-one correspondence.
