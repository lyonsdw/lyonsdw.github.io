        <title>Preface</title>

<p>The purpose of this text is to provide a first-year introduction to
  upper-level mathematics in the undergraduate curriculum. <em>Not Just
  Calculus</em> acknowledges that a single course on proof
  writing in the second year is too little, too late. Using topics that will be useful
  in later courses, this book accelerates the process of "mathematical
  maturity" through active reading, reasoning, problem solving, and writing.
</p>

<p>
  This text can be used for a one-semester course, or for two
  half-credit courses spread over two semesters in the first year. This
  text is <em>not</em> intended to replace a formal introduction to
  proof writing. It <em>is</em> intended to widen students' perspectives
  beyond high school mathematics and introductory calculus courses.
</p>

<p>
The exposition is overtly designed for active reading. There are almost
no examples, and almost no illustrating figures. Embedded reading
exercises ("Checkpoints") require the reader to construct examples and
make drawings. End-of-section problems ("Exercises") guide students in
constructing short arguments to prove if-then propositions. An overall
theme is that a few carefully chosen, powerful abstractions (such as
sets and functions, modular arithmetic, linear transformations of the
plane, and complex numbers, to name a few) form the basis for widely
various applications.
</p>

<p>Many thanks to my readers and problem checkers!

<!--<p>
Two caveats regarding pedagogical orthodoxy: First, anyone who holds religious views on
the distinction between points and vectors should preview
<xref ref="vector_operations_section"/>. Second, our account of complex numbers in
<xref ref="complex_plane_section"/> is shamelessly geometric, in the
spirit of William Rowan Hamilton, and looks a bit different from many
texts.

   <commentary component="instructor"><title><em>Instructor's Solutions</em>
       edition</title>
     <p>Instructor's solutions are intended for the instructor
     only. Please do not give copies of instructor's solutions to
     students. Student's learn by constructing their own derivations,
     explanations, and proofs. Student access to complete solutions
     undermines the goals of the course.
