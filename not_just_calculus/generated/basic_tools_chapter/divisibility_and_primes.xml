The statement <m>6|3</m> is false. There is no

is true, because <m>6=3\cdot 2</m>. The symbols <q><m>6/3</m></q>

<p>  Here are two
  important facts about divisibility and primes.</p>

  <theorem xml:id ="divisionalgorithm">  <title>The Division
  Algorithm</title><idx><h>Division Algorithm</h></idx>
<statement>    <p>Let <m>m</m> be a positive
integer. For every integer <m>n</m> there are unique integers <m>q,r</m> that

</statement>
  </theorem>
  
  <theorem xml:id="fundthmarith"><title>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</title><idx><h>
	Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</h></idx>
    <statement><p>
	 Every integer <m>n\gt 1</m> can be written as a product of primes. Further, this prime
factorization is unique. That means that if
<me>n=p_1p_2\cdots p_k=q_1q_2\cdots q_\ell</me> for primes <m>p_i,q_j</m>, then
<m>k=\ell</m> and there is a rearrangement of the subscripts for which
<m>p_i=q_i</m> for <m>1\leq i\leq k</m>. 	
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

<p>  Here is a useful corollary that relates divisibility to the
  Division Algorithm.
</p>

  <corollary xml:id="dividesiffr0"><statement><p>Let <m>m</m> be a positive integer,
	let <m>n</m> be any integer, and let <m>n=qm+r</m>, where 
	<m>q,r</m> are integers, with <m>r</m> in the range <m>0\leq r\lt
	  m</m>, as guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. Then we

    </statement><proof><p>Suppose <m>r=0</m>. Then <m>n=mq+r</m> reduces

	we have <m>n=mk</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. The Division
	algorithm says that <m>n=mq+r</m> is the <em>only</em> possible
	way to write <m>n</m> as a multiple of <m>m</m> with a remainder
	in the range <m>0\leq r\lt m</m>. Therefore we conclude
	that <m>q=k</m> and <m>r=0</m>.

  </corollary>

  <p><alert>Remark on the statement and proof of <xref ref="dividesiffr0"/>.</alert>
    The phrase <q>if and only if</q>
    <idx><h>if and only if</h>
  </idx>
  means that the following two statements hold.
    <ol>
      <li>If <m>r=0</m>, then <m>m|n</m>.
      </li>
      <li>If <m>m|n</m>, then <m>r=0</m>.

     It often works well to construct a proof for an <q>if and only
      if</q>
     statement in two parts, one part for each of the two
    <q>if-then</q>
    statements. Statement 1 is called the <q>if</q>
     part of the
    <q>if and only if</q>
    statement, and statement 2 is called the <q>only if</q>
    part of the <q>if and only if</q>
     statement.

  <p>Here is a fact that demonstrates the power of the Division
  Algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.</p>

<proposition xml:id="infprimeprop">
  <statement><p>There are infinitely many prime numbers.</p>
  </statement>
  <proof><p>
We wish to show that there are
infinitely many primes. Suppose, on the contrary, that there exist only
finitely many primes, say <m>p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_r</m>. Let <m>s=p_1p_2\cdots
p_r+1</m>. Using the division algorithm to divide <m>s</m> by <m>p_1</m>, we have
<m>s= p_1q+r</m> with <m>q=p_2p_3\cdots p_r</m> and <m>r=1</m>. By
<xref ref="dividesiffr0"/>, the fact that <m>r=1</m>
means that <m>p_1</m> does <em>not</em>
divide <m>s</m>, so <m>p_1</m> cannot appear in
the prime factorization of <m>s</m>. A similar argument shows that none of
the <m>p_j</m>'s can appear in the prime factorization of <m>s</m>. This
contradicts the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that says <m>s</m> can be
expressed as a product of primes. We conclude that there are
infinitely many primes.
    </p>
  </proof>
</proposition>

<p>
  <alert>Remark on the proof of <xref ref="infprimeprop"/>.</alert> The
    proof uses a logic structure called <term>proof by
    contradiction</term><idx><h>proof by contradiction</h>
  </idx>. To show that a claim is true (<q>there are infinitely many
    primes</q>), a proof by contradiction
    begins by supposing that the opposite of the claim is true (<q>suppose
    there are only finitely many primes</q>). Next,
    we show that there is an impossible consequence (<q>the Fundamental
    Theorem of Arithmetic is false</q>). We conclude that the opposite
  claim (<q>there are only finitely many primes</q>) must be false, so the
  original claim (<q>there are infinitely many primes</q>) is true.

<exercise xml:id="infmanyprimeproofexer">
  <statement>
    <p>In the proof of <xref ref="infprimeprop"/>, a number <m>s</m> is
    constructed by multiplying together a collection of prime numbers
      and then adding 1. Then we conclude that <m>s</m> is not divisible
    by any of the primes in the original collection. Must it be the case
    that <m>s</m> itself must be prime, but just not
    equal to any of the
    primes in the original collection? Does it always
    turn out that the product of a collection of primes, plus 1, is a
    prime number?
    If not, give an example of a collection of prime numbers
    that, when multiplied together and increased by 1, is not prime.
    </p>
  </statement>
</exercise>

<aside component="instructor"><title>Instructor's solution for

  <p>No. For example, we have <m>3\cdot 5+1=16</m>, which is not prime.

  <exercise xml:id="evenoddexer"><statement><p>
	An integer is called <term>even</term> if it is divisible
	by <m>2</m>, and otherwise it is called <term>odd</term>. Use
	the Division Algorithm to show that an integer <m>n</m> is odd
	if and only if <m>n=2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then use this fact to show that the product
    of two odd integers must be odd.

  </exercise>

<aside component="instructor"><title>Instructor's solution for

  <p>Let <m>n</m> be an integer. Use the Division Algorithm to
    write <m>n=2q+r</m> for unique integers <m>q,r</m> with <m>r</m> in
    the range <m>0\leq r\lt 2</m>. If <m>n</m> is odd, we must
    have <m>r=1</m>. On the other hand, if <m>n=2k+1</m>, then it must
    be that <m>2\nmid n</m>. This proves the <q>if and only if</q>
        statement. Now, let <m>n=2k+1</m>, <m>m=2\ell+1</m> be odd. The we
    have <m>nm=(2k+1)(2\ell+1) = 2(2k\ell + k+\ell) + 1</m>, which is odd.

  <exercise xml:id="primedividesexer"><statement><p> Let <m>p</m> be
  prime and suppose that <m>p|(ab)</m> for some integers

<aside component="instructor"><title>Instructor's solution for

  <p>
    The assumption that <m>p|(ab)</m> means that <m>ab=pc</m> for some integer <m>c</m>.
    Use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to write <m>a,b,c</m> as products
    of primes <m>a=p_1\cdots p_n</m>, <m>b=q_1\cdots q_m</m>, <m>c=r_1\cdots
    r_\ell</m>. Thus we have
    <me>p_1\cdots p_nq_1\cdots q_m = pr_1\cdots r_\ell.</me>
    By the uniqueness statement in the Fundamental Theorem of
    Arithmetic, it must be that <m>p</m> is equal to one of the <m>p_i</m>'s or
    <m>p</m> is equal to one of the <m>q_i</m>'s (or both). We conclude that it
