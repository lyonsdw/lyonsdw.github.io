  "body": " Preface  The purpose of this text is to provide a first-year introduction to upper-level mathematics in the undergraduate curriculum. Not Just Calculus acknowledges that a single course on proof writing in the second year is too little, too late. Using topics that will be useful in later courses, this book accelerates the process of \"mathematical maturity\" through active reading, reasoning, problem solving, and writing.  This text can be used for a one-semester course, or for two half-credit courses spread over two semesters in the first year. This text is not intended to replace a formal introduction to proof writing. It is intended to widen students' perspectives beyond high school mathematics and introductory calculus courses.  The exposition is overtly designed for active reading. There are almost no examples, and almost no illustrating figures. Embedded reading exercises (\"Checkpoints\") require the reader to construct examples and make drawings. End-of-section problems (\"Exercises\") guide students in constructing short arguments to prove if-then propositions. An overall theme is that a few carefully chosen, powerful abstractions (such as sets and functions, modular arithmetic, linear transformations of the plane, and complex numbers, to name a few) form the basis for widely various applications.  Many thanks to my readers and problem checkers! Sydney Manning, Kailynn Bardo, MacKenzie Carr, Anthony Ciaravino, Ashleigh Rogers, Justin DeShong, Evan Czlapinski, Eric Estes    "

Given an object and a set , exactly one of two things is true: either is an element of , denoted   is an element of   , or is not an element of , denoted   is not an element of   . Two sets are equal set equal sets if they contain exactly the same elements.  To denote a set that contains a small number of elements, we list the elements, separated by commas, and enclosed in curly brackets \" \"   curly brackets  . For example, the set contains elements , and contains no other objects. In this notation, the order in which the objects are listed does not matter. Redundancy also does not matter: the same object may be listed more than once. For example, we may write   Another way to denote a set is the notation , where the colon \":\" is pronounced \"such that\". For example, the closed unit interval of the real numbers is the set .  The set that contains no elements is called the empty set set the empty set , denoted   the empty set  .  We say that is a subset set subset of , denoted   is a subset of   , if every element in the set is also in the set , and we write   is not a subset of   to indicate that there is at least one element in that is not an element in . A consequence of these definitions is that if , then and . Conversely, if and , then . Another consequence is that the empty set is a subset of any given set because there is no element in that is not in .     Which of these are correct (one, both, or neither)? Discuss.

The (Cartesian) product Cartesian product of the set with the set , denoted the (Cartesian) product of sets  is the set of all ordered pairs of the form , where is an element of set and is an element of set .  A subset of the product of sets is called a relation from to relation between sets  . A relation is called a function from to function if every element in is the left entry of exactly one element in . We write   a function with domain and codomain   to indicate that the relation is a function. The set is called the domain function domain , the set is called the codomain function codomain , and the set is called the graph function graph of the function . We write     is an element of   to indicate that is an element of . If , we say that is the image of under function image of a point and that is a preimage of under function preimage of a point . Informally, we may refer to a function a process that transforms inputs (elements of the domain set) to outputs in the codomain set. When the sets are understood or implied by context, it is common usage to refer to the function simply as \"the function \".  To express that a relation consists of three parts, namely, the sets , , and , we say that a relation is a triple  . To say that relations and are equal means that , , and .

Given a relation , the inverse relation to  inverse relation  , denoted , is the relation from to given by In general, the inverse relation of a function is not a function. To say that the inverse relation is a function, it must be true that every in is the left entry of exactly one element in .

We say that an integer  divides divides an integer , written     divides   , if for some integer . If , we say that is divisible divisible by , and we say is a divisor divisor of . We write     does not divide   to indicate that does not divide . An integer whose only positive divisors are and is called prime prime .  Say which of the following are true, or false, or neither. Explain.    Here are two important facts about divisibility and primes.   The Division Algorithm Division Algorithm   Let be a positive integer. For every integer there are unique integers that satisfy The number is called the quotient quotient and the number is called the remainder remainder for dividing by .    The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  Every integer can be written as a product of primes. Further, this prime factorization is unique. That means that if for primes , then and there is a rearrangement of the subscripts for which for .    Here is a useful corollary that relates divisibility to the Division Algorithm.  Let be a positive integer, let be any integer, and let , where are integers, with in the range , as guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. Then we have if and only if .  Suppose . Then reduces to , so . Conversely, suppose that . Then we have for some integer . The Division algorithm says that is the only possible way to write as a multiple of with a remainder in the range . Therefore we conclude that and .    Remark on the statement and proof of . The phrase \"if and only if\" if and only if  means that the following two statements hold.  If , then .  If , then .  It often works well to construct a proof for an \"if and only if\" statement in two parts, one part for each of the two \"if-then\" statements. Statement 1 is called the \"if\" part of the \"if and only if\" statement, and statement 2 is called the \"only if\" part of the \"if and only if\" statement.   Prove the following statement: An integer is divisible by 6 if and only if can be written as a product of integers such that is divisible by 2 and is divisible by 3. Write a proof in two parts. For part 1, suppose that is divisible by 2 and is divisible by 3, and then show that is divisible by . For part 2, suppose that is divisible by 6, and then show that there exist integers so that , and that is divisible by 2 and is divisible by 3.   Here is a fact that demonstrates the power of the Division Algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.   There are infinitely many prime numbers.   We wish to show that there are infinitely many primes. Suppose, on the contrary, that there exist only finitely many primes, say . Let . Using the division algorithm to divide by , we have with and . By , the fact that means that does not divide , so cannot appear in the prime factorization of . A similar argument shows that none of the 's can appear in the prime factorization of . This contradicts the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that says can be expressed as a product of primes. We conclude that there are infinitely many primes.     Remark on the proof of . The proof uses a logic structure called proof by contradiction proof by contradiction  . To show that a claim is true (\"there are infinitely many primes\"), a proof by contradiction begins by supposing that the opposite of the claim is true (\"suppose there are only finitely many primes\"). Next, we show that there is an impossible consequence (\"the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is false\"). We conclude that the opposite claim (\"there are only finitely many primes\") must be false, so the original claim (\"there are infinitely many primes\") is true.   In the proof of , a number is constructed by multiplying together a collection of prime numbers and then adding 1. Then we conclude that is not divisible by any of the primes in the original collection. Must it be the case that itself must be prime, but just not equal to any of the primes in the original collection? Does it always turn out that the product of a collection of primes, plus 1, is a prime number? If not, give an example of a collection of prime numbers that, when multiplied together and increased by 1, is not prime.    An integer is called even if it is divisible by , and otherwise it is called odd . Use the Division Algorithm to show that an integer is odd if and only if for some integer . Then use this fact to show that the product of two odd integers must be odd.   Let be prime and suppose that for some integers . Show that it must be the case that or (or both).   Consolidating prime factors  Here is another version of (the FTA). The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, version 2 (FTAv2). Every integer can be written in the form where are primes with , and the numbers and the number are positive integers. Further, this expression is unique in the sense that if for some increasing sequence of primes and positive integers , then , for all , and for all .   Consider the products where , , , and . Does the fact that violate the FTA? Write the factorization for 108 given by the FTAv2. Find the values of , , and .  Why do the FTA and the FTAv2 assume that ? What happens if ? What happens if we change the definition of prime numbers to allow 1 to be a prime number?  Suppose that an integer has prime factorization as given FTAv2, and suppose a positive integer divides .

He peered through the narrow slits of his bloodshot eyes, glaring through the murk of the humid dusty darkness of the fleabag lobby, and said, \"for you a deal.\" \"How much?\" said the big guy, sweat trickling down his face, staining the collar of his dingy shirt which didn't appear to have been washed in weeks. Noticing the telltale bulge of a revolver under the stranger's dirt-stained jacket, the clerk replied, \"First day one cent. Second day two cents. Third day four. Every day it doubles.\" The stranger's face drew into a knot as he scrutinized the greasy poker-faced clerk. He said, \"That's nothin'. What's the hitch?\"  How much would the stranger pay on July 31st?  What would the bill be for the month of July?      An investment portfolio has holdings in instruments and . At a certain moment, both instruments have a value of dollars. Beginning at that same moment, the value of drops exactly dollars every day, and the value of loses percent of its value every day.  Assuming that the values of both investments are continuous functions of time, Which of is the first to reach a value of 20 dollars?  Explain how you know, without calculating, which investment is the first to reach a value of zero.      Zeno's Paradox The Greek philosopher Zeno (ca. 450BC) considered the following motion problem. A rabbit and a turtle agree to run a race. Displaying good sportsmanship, the rabbit, who can run faster, gives the turtle a head start. Zeno argued that the rabbit will never catch the turtle, as follows. To catch the turtle, the rabbit must first travel from the starting point to the turtle's starting point. During this time, the turtle will advance. Let's call the turtle's new location point 2. Now the rabbit must travel to point 2, but during that time, the turtle advances to point 3. And so on. This process defines an infinite sequence of distinct points. Traveling from each one to the next requires a positive amount of time. Since an infinite sum of positive numbers must be infinite, Zeno concludes that the rabbit will never catch the turtle. Of course, Zeno knew there must be some flaw in this argument, but was unable to resolve the paradox satisfactorily.  Analyze Zeno's paradox under the following assumptions: the rabbit travels at a constant speed of 5 feet per second; the turtle travels at a constant speed of 2 feet per second; and the head start distance is 10 feet. Place coordinates on the race track with the rabbit beginning at 0 and the turtle beginning at 10, with both running in the positive direction.  Using high school algebra and the formula find the location where the rabbit catches the turtle, and the time elapsed from the beginning of the race to the point where the rabbit catches the turtle.  Find the sequence of distances traveled by the rabbit from the rabbit's starting point to the turtle's starting point, from there to point 2, from point 2 to point 3, etc.  Find the sequence of times that elapse while the rabbit traveled the distance intervals in the previous part.  Use the theory of geometric sequences to resolve Zeno's paradox by reconciling your findings in the previous steps of this problem.     The following problem is a modern version of Zeno's paradox. It is taken from an article by George Andrews in the January 1998 issue of the American Mathematical Monthly , Vol. 105 No. 1 and is attributed to a Prof. Sleator.  Two trees are one mile apart. A drib flies from one tree to the other and back, making the first trip at 10 miles per hour, the return at 20 miles per hour, the next at 40 and so on, each successive mile at twice the speed of the preceding.

Write the first five terms of the sequence times taken for trips 1, 2, 3, etc. Write an explicit formula for this sequence.  Write the first five terms of the sequence of how much time it takes the drib to travel 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles, etc. Write an explicit formula for this sequence.  Where is the drib 12 minutes after the first trip begins?       The Snowflake Curve Koch's snowflake is a geometric figure built recursively, as follows. Stage 1 is an equilateral triangle whose sides are 1 unit in length. To produce Stage from Stage , perform the replacement of edges illustrated in .  Each edge at stage is replaced by four edges at stage      The snowflake is the figure obtained after infinitely many stages. Stages 1, 2, 3 and the finished snowflake are shown in .

Hint: Sum the terms of the geometric sequence from the previous part. Watch out! The first couple of terms may not fit the pattern of the sequence.  What is the perimeter of the snowflake?  What is the area of the snowflake?        Rational and Irrational Numbers  A rational number rational number is a number that can be written in the form for some integers . An irrational number irrational number  is a real number that is not rational. The standard symbol for the set of rational numbers the set of rational numbers  is  the set of rational numbers  . In set notation, we have The following is a classic proof by contradiction that proves that at least one irrational number exists.   The number is irrational.   Suppose on the contrary that is rational, where are integers. We may assume both are positive, and we may assume that the fraction is reduced, that is, that have no common factors other than 1. Squaring both sides of and rearranging, we have . This says that is even, so it must be that itself is even. That means we can write for some integer . Substituting for in the equation , we get , which simplifies to . Now we see that is even, so it must be that is even. But this means that are both divisible by 2, which contradicts the assumption that share no common factors. We conclude that is irrational.     Justify the statement in the proof above that says \"so itself must be even\". Give a proof that uses the results of . Give another proof that uses only the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.   It turns out that irrational numbers are not rare or isolated among the real numbers; the rational numbers and irrational numbers are \"everywhere\" in the real line. The following proposition makes this statement precise. Recall that an open interval of the real line is a set of the form for some real numbers with . We say that a subset is dense in if every open interval contains an element of .  The set of rational numbers is dense in . The set of irrational numbers is dense in .   (This is an outline of the main points of the proof that is dense in . In exercises below, you will complete the details of the proof of the density of the rationals, and you will also prove the density of the irrationals.) Let be given, with , and let . Choose an integer large enough so that . We claim that there is some integer multiple of that lies between and , that is, there is some integer such that . If not, then there exist consecutive integer multiples of so that But then we would have , a contradiction. Thus we have shown that the open interval contains a rational number. We conclude that is dense in .      In the proof outline of above, how do we know that we can \"choose an integer large enough\"?  Explain why it is that \"then we would have \" (immediately after the displayed equation).  What does that contradict?  What allows us to \"conclude that is dense in \"?      Let be a positive integer. Show that either is a perfect square (that is, for some integer ), or is irrational.  Let be a positive integer, and suppose that is rational, where are positive integers that share no common factors other than 1. Squaring and rearranging, we have . Let be a prime factor of . Explain why it must be that . Explain why this implies that . Explain how this implies the desired conclusion.   Complete the proof of by showing that the irrationals are dense in the reals.  Apply the density of to the interval .   Choose an angle . Starting at the point , walk around the unit circle in a counterclockwise direction, taking steps of size . What is the smallest whole number of steps you have to take until you come for the first time to a point that you've already stepped on? Where is this first repeated location?  Find the answer for degrees.  Find the answer for degrees.  Find the answer for degrees.  Find the answer for radians.  Find the answer for radian. You may use the fact that is irrational.  Find the answer for an arbitrary value of . Suggestion: Rather than degrees or radians, you might consider using revolutions for your angle units.     Your intelligent younger cousin declares to you that is less than 2. How do you explain that is actually equal to 2?   Show that a number is rational if and only if it has a decimal representation that eventually repeats or terminates.   Prove the following facts about terminating decimal expansions. Suppose that for some nonnegative integers . Show that the rational number ( also an integer) has a terminating decimal expansion.  Suppose that the reduced rational number ( integers with no common factors, ) has a terminating decimal expansion. Show that for some nonnegative integers .        More Sets and Functions    Let be a set. Given a subset of , the characteristic function characteristic function for a set  for (relative to ), denoted  characteristic function for the set   , is given by Let be subsets of . Prove the following. The symbol \" \" denotes addition modulo 2.   if and only if               Let be sets. Prove the following (the first two are distributive laws distributive laws for sets  for sets and the second two are De Morgan's laws De Morgan's laws ). Hint: use characteristic functions from above.             An equivalence relation equivalence relation  on a set is a set of ordered pairs of elements of that satisfies the following.    for every (the reflexive property)  if is in then is in (the symmetric property)  if is in and is in , then is in (the transitive property)  The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a set are sets of the form where is an element of .  Write out all possible equivalence relations for .  Write out all of the equivalence classes for each of the equivalence relations in part a.   In , you showed that equivalence modulo an integer is an equivalence relation on the integers . Write out all of the equivalence classes for this equivalence relation.  Give an example of a set of ordered pairs of that satisfies exactly two of the three properties in the definition of equivalence relation.        Pythagorean Triples  A 3-tuple of positive integers is called a Pythagorean triple Pythagorean triple  if there exists a right triangle with leg lengths and hypotenuse length . A Pythagorean triple is primitive primitive Pythagorean triple  if have no common divisor (other than 1).  A point on the unit circle is called a rational point if both are rational numbers. Let be the open first quadrant of the unit circle in the -plane (that is, points on the unit circle with both coordinates positive). The following exercises explore the details of the one-to-one correspondences    Pythagorean triple and associated unit circle point      Given a Pythagorean triple (not necessarily primitive), show that is a rational point on (see ).   Let be a primitive Pythagorean triple. Show that share no common divisors other than 1.   Let be a point in with both rational. Show that there is a unique reduced Pythagorean triple that maps to via . Use this to explain why there is a one-to-one correspondence    Given a point on , let be the line through and . Let be the -coordinate of the intersection of with the axis. See . This defines a one-to-one correspondence called stereographic projection . Show that is given by .  Stereographic projection      Find a formula for . Verify that your formula really gives an inverse for by showing that and .   Use the formulas for to explain why there is a one-to-one correspondence    From the correspondences established in this exercise, what is the rational number associated to the Pythagorean triple ? To ? What primitive Pythagorean triple corresponds to the rational number 3? To the rational number ?     "

  "body": " The Cartesian Plane  Let denote the set of real numbers. The Cartesian plane Cartesian Plane  The Cartesian plane is named in honor of the 17th-century mathematician and philosopher René Descartes. (or the real coordinate plane , or simply, the plane ) is the set of ordered pairs of real numbers.   The sum sum in    of two ordered pairs and is defined by The scalar multiple scalar multiple  of the real number times the ordered pair is defined by The dot product dot product  of two ordered pairs and is defined by   An ordered pair is sometimes called a point in , and sometimes called a vector , depending on the nature of the object represented by . In drawings, a point is a dot, and a vector is an arrow. We use capital letters in italic font to denote points, for example, . We use bold lower case letters in Roman font, for example (better for typing), or lower case letters with an arrow written above them, for example (better for handwriting), to denote vectors. Given points and , we write to denote the ordered pair , which we interpret as a vector, depicted by a directed line segment that begins at and ends at . Note that the point  has only one possible drawing, that is, a dot at the location . By contrast, the vector  has infinitely many possible drawings: given any point , vector is depicted by an arrow that begins at and ends at . Another way to say this is that two arrows are equal as vectors if , even though we may have and .   Warning about notation: Many texts make a distinction between points and vectors by using the notation for a point and for a vector. In these notes, we use for both the point and the vector. The point and the vector are not equal, because a point and a vector are different types of objects. The correct relationship between and is given by , where is the point . The take-away message is that you must always be clear whether you mean a point or a vector when you write an ordered pair.  The ordered pair is called the origin origin in  or the zero vector zero vector , depending on whether we are thinking of as a point or as a vector, respectively. It is common practice to use the capital letter to denote the origin and to use the symbols or to denote the zero vector. The vectors and are called the standard basis vectors standard basis vectors in     standard basis vectors in   . We have the following expressions for in terms of the standard basis vectors.   Verify each of the equalities in .   The norm norm of a vector or modulus modulus of a vector of an ordered pair , denoted    norm of the ordered pair   , is defined by The unit circle unit circle  unit circle is the set of all ordered pairs in the Cartesian plane with norm equal to one. Geometrically, is a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin. It is useful to navigate on the unit circle with a single real parameter, where the parameter value 0 corresponds to the point . A parameter value corresponds to the point that lies at the end of a counterclockwise arc along that begins at and has length . For , the point lies at the end of a clockwise arc that begins at and has length . Another way to say this is that is the radian measure of the oriented angle , where and , and . The function (often called the wrapping function wrapping function  ) is given by where is in radians. Note that is periodic: the circumference of the unit circle is , so we have for every integer .  Draw a figure that illustrates the points , the angle , and the oriented arc from to on . Draw one figure for a positive value of , and draw another figure for a negative value of .   Every point is a positive scalar multiple of a unique point on the unit circle, as follows. Let be a point in with (unlike in the previous paragraph, is not necessarily a point on the unit circle), and again let and . Let be the radian measure of the angle , and let . It is easy to check that where . The expression is called the polar form  polar form of a vector for . The number is called (an) argument argument of a vector of , denoted .

Show that polar coordinates are not unique by finding three different pairs of polar coordinates for the point . How many different values of are possible? What are they? How many different values of are possible? What are they?  Rotations about a point in the plane combine in a simple way: a rotation by radians, followed by a rotation by radians, results in a combined rotation by radians. It is useful to encode the composition of rotations in a multiplication operation on . Given points on the unit circle, let be defined by   Let be points in .

Conventions on linear operations with points and vectors  In these notes, addition and scaling operations are defined for ordered pairs, regardless of whether we view the ordered pairs as points or as vectors. Traditional convention places some restrictions that we have ignored, and will continue to ignore, but nevertheless will present here for the reader's cultural awareness. In short, traditional orthodoxy goes like this:  The operations and are allowed when and are both vectors , and the resulting ordered pairs , are interpreted as vectors .  Addition and scaling of ordered pairs are discouraged, or even banned outright, if the ordered pairs are both points , except for the following two cases:  If and are points , then the operation is allowed, and the resulting ordered pair is interpreted as a vector , denoted .  If is a point and is a vector , then the operation is allowed, and the resulting ordered pair is interpreted as a point .
