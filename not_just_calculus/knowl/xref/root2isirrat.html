We may assume both <span class="process-math">\(a,b\)</span> are positive, and we may assume that the fraction <span class="process-math">\(a/b\)</span> is reduced, that is, that <span class="process-math">\(a,b\)</span> have no common factors other than 1. Squaring both sides of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}=a/b\)</span> and rearranging, we have <span class="process-math">\(2b^2=a^2\text{.}\)</span> This says that <span class="process-math">\(a^2\)</span> is even, so it must be that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> itself is even. That means we can write <span class="process-math">\(a=2k\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Substituting <span class="process-math">\(2k\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in the equation <span class="process-math">\(2b^2=a^2\text{,}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(2b^2=(2k)^2=4k^2\text{,}\)</span> which simplifies to <span class="process-math">\(b^2=2k^2\text{.}\)</span> Now we see that <span class="process-math">\(b^2\)</span> is even, so it must be that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is even. But this means that <span class="process-math">\(a,b\)</span> are both divisible by 2, which contradicts the assumption that <span class="process-math">\(a,b\)</span> share no common factors. We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is irrational.</div></article></details><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="basic_tools_problems_section.html#root2isirrat">in-context</a></span>
