</h5>
<div class="para">The Greek philosopher Zeno (ca. 450BC) considered the following motion problem.  A rabbit and a turtle agree to run a race.  Displaying good sportsmanship, the rabbit, who can run faster, gives the turtle a head start.  Zeno argued that the rabbit will never catch the turtle, as follows.  To catch the turtle, the rabbit must first travel from the starting point to the turtle’s starting point.  During this time, the turtle will advance.  Let’s call the turtle’s new location point 2.  Now the rabbit must travel to point 2, but during that time, the turtle advances to point 3.  And so on.  This process defines an infinite sequence of distinct points.  Traveling from each one to the next requires a positive amount of time.  Since an infinite sum of positive numbers must be infinite, Zeno concludes that the rabbit will never catch the turtle.  Of course, Zeno knew there must be some flaw in this argument, but was unable to resolve the paradox satisfactorily.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Analyze Zeno’s paradox under the following assumptions: the rabbit travels at a constant speed of 5 feet per second; the turtle travels at a constant speed of 2 feet per second; and the head start distance is 10 feet.  Place coordinates on the race track with the rabbit beginning at 0 and the turtle beginning at 10, with both running in the positive direction.</div>
