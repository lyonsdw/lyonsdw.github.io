Injectivity and Surjectivity
</title>

<p>
  In <xref ref="functions_section"/>, we note that a
  function is invertible if every element 
  in the codomain has exactly one preimage.
  A function
  is <term>surjective</term><idx><h>function</h><h>surjective
      function</h></idx>,
  or <term>onto</term><idx><h>function</h><h>onto function</h></idx>,
  if every element of the codomain has <em>at least</em>
  one preimage. A function is <term>injective</term><idx><h>function</h><h>injective

  or <term>one-to-one</term><idx><h>function</h><h>one-to-one function</h></idx>,
if every element of

  one preimage.
 A function

  if it is both
injective and surjective, that is, if every element in the codomain is
the right entry of exactly one element of the function. Thus, the
  adjectives "bijective" and "invertible" mean the same thing. A bijective
  function is also called a <term>one-to-one

  <proposition xml:id="rightinvimpliessurjective">
    <statement>
      <p>Let <m>f\colon S\to T</m> be a function, and suppose that
	there exists a
	function <m>g\colon T\to S</m> such that <m>f\of g =
	  \One_T</m>. Then <m>f</m> is surjective.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>Let <m>t_0</m> be an element of <m>T</m>, and
	let <m>s_0=g(t_0)</m>. Applying <m>f</m> to both sides of the
	last equation, we have <m>f(s_0)=f(g(t_0))</m>. Because <m>f\of
	g=\One_T</m>, the last expression simplifies
	to <m>\One_T(t_0)=t_0</m>. This shows that the preimage
	of <m>t_0</m> under <m>f</m> has at least one element,
	namely <m>s_0</m>. Because <m>t_0</m> was an arbitrary choice,
	we conclude that every element in <m>T</m> has at least one
	element in its preimage under <m>f</m>. Therefore <m>f</m> is
	surjective.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </proposition>

  
  
  <proposition xml:id="leftinvimpliesinjective">
    <statement>
      <p>Let <m>f\colon S\to T</m> be a function, and suppose that
	there exists a
	function <m>g\colon T\to S</m> such that <m>g\of f =
	  \One_S</m>. Then <m>f</m> is injective.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>Let <m>t_0</m> be an element of <m>T</m>, and
	let <m>s_0=g(t_0)</m>. If <m>s_1</m> is a preimage of <m>t_0</m>
	  under <m>f</m>, then <m>f(s_1)=t_0</m>. Applying <m>g</m> to
	  both sides of <m>f(s_1)=t_0</m>, we have
	  <m>g(f(s_1))=g(t_0)</m>. On the right side, we
	  have <m>g(t_0)=s_0</m>. On the left, we
	  have <m>g(f(s_1))=(g\circ f)(s_1)=\One(s_1)=s_1</m>. Therefore
	  we have <m>s_1=s_0</m>. This shows that any preimage
	  of <m>t_0</m> under <m>f</m> must be equal to <m>s_0</m>. 
	Because <m>t_0</m> was an arbitrary choice,
	we conclude that every element in <m>T</m> has at most one
	preimage under <m>f</m>. Therefore <m>f</m> is
	injective.

	    proof? If the answer is "no", then

	    No. It is possible that <m>t_0</m> could have 0 preimages
	    under <m>f</m>. The second proof shows that <em>if</em> <m>t_0</m>
	    has a preimage, then in has only one
	    preimage. Example: let <m>S=\{a\}</m>, <m>T=\{x,y\}</m>, <m>f=\{(a,x)\}</m>, <m>g=\{(x,a),(y,a)\}</m>,
	    and <m>t_0=y</m>. The

	    No. It is possible for <m>t_0</m> to have many preimages

    The answer to both questions is yes. Let <m>f\colon S\to T</m>
    and <m>g\colon T\to U</m> be functions. Suppose that both <m>f,g</m>
    are injective, and let <m>u\in U.</m> Because <m>g</m> is injective,
    the preimage <m>g^{-1}(u)</m> has at most one
    element. If <m>g^{-1}(u)</m> empty, then <m>(g\circ f)^{-1}(u)</m> is
    also empty. If <m>g^{-1}(u)</m> not empty, then <m>g^{-1}(u)</m>
    contains 1 element, say <m>t\in T</m>. Because <m>f</m> is
    injective, the preimage <m>f^{-1}(t)</m> contains at most one
    element, so <m>(g\circ f)^{-1}(u)</m> contains at most one
    element. Thus, in all cases, <m>(g\circ f)^{-1}(u)</m> contains at
    most one element. We conclude that <m>g\circ f</m> is injective. Now
    suppose that <m>f,g</m> are both surjective, and let <m>u\in
      U</m>. The preimage <m>g^{-1}(u)</m> contains at least one
    element, say <m>t\in T</m>. The preimage <m>f^{-1}(t)</m> contains
    at least one element, say <m>s\in S</m>. Therefore <m>s\in (g\circ
      f)^{-1}(u)</m>. We conclude that <m>g\circ f</m> is surjective.

  <exercise xml:id="socksnshoesexer"><statement><p>
	    Suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both invertible, and that the
    composition <m>g\of f</m> is defined. Show that <m>g\of f</m> is invertible
    and that <m>(g\of f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \of g^{-1}</m>. This fact is referred
    to as the "socks and shoes" property.      
    </p></statement>

<commentary component="instructor"><title>Instructor's solution for

  <p>
      Let <m>h=f^{-1} \of g^{-1}</m>. Let <m>s</m> be in the domain of <m>f</m>. We have
<md>        <mrow>(h \of (g\of f))(s)
    \amp= h(g(f(s)) \amp \amp \text{(definition of composition)}</mrow>
  <mrow> \amp= f^{-1}(g^{-1}(g(f(s)))) \amp \amp (\text{definition of } h)</mrow>
<mrow> \amp= f^{-1}((g^{-1}\of g)(f(s))) \amp \amp (\text{(associativity of

<mrow>\amp= s\amp \amp (f^{-1}\of f \text{ is the identity

      This establishes that <m>h\of (g\of f)</m> is the identity function on
      the domain of <m>f</m>. A similar derivation shows that <m>(g\of f)\of h</m>
      is the identity function on the codomain of <m>g</m>. We conclude that

      \of g^{-1}</m>, as desired.
