  Sets
</title>

  <p>
    A <term>set</term><idx>set</idx> is a collection of objects called
    the <term>elements</term><idx><h>set</h><h>element of a set</h></idx>
    or <term>members</term><idx><h>set</h>
      <h>member of a set</h></idx> of the set. Given
    an object <m>x</m> and a set <m>A</m>, exactly one of two things is
    true: either <m>x</m> is an element of <m>A</m>, denoted <m>x\in
    A</m><notation><usage><m>x\in A</m>
      </usage>
      <description><m>x</m>
	is an element of <m>A</m>
      </description>
    </notation>, or <m>x</m> is not an element of <m>A</m>, denoted <m>x\not
    \in A</m><notation><usage><m>\not\in</m>
      </usage>
      <description><m>x</m>
	is not an element of <m>A</m>
      </description>
    </notation>. Two sets are
    <term>equal</term><idx><h>set</h><h>equal sets</h></idx>
    if they contain exactly the same elements.
  </p>

<p>  To denote a set that contains a small number of elements, we list the
  elements, separated by commas, and enclosed in curly brackets
  "<m>\{\ldots\}</m>"<notation><usage><m>\{\ldots\}</m>
      </usage>
      <description>curly brackets
      </description>
    </notation>. For
  example, the set <m>A=\{x,y,z\}</m> contains elements <m>x,y,z</m>, and contains no other
  objects. In this notation, the order in which
  the objects are listed does not matter. Redundancy also does not
  matter: the same object may be listed
  more than once. For example, we may write
  <me>A=\{x,y,z\}=\{y,z,x\}=\{y,x,y,z\}.
  </me>
</p>

<p> Another way to denote a set is the notation
  <m>\{x\colon x \text{ satisfies condition } C\}</m>, where the colon ":" is pronounced
  "such that". For example, the <em>closed unit interval</em> of the real
  numbers <m>\R</m> is the set <m>\{x\in \R \colon 0\leq x\leq 1\}</m>.
</p>

<p>The set that
  contains no elements is called the <term>empty
  set</term><idx><h>set</h><h>the empty set</h></idx>, denoted
  <m>\emptyset</m><notation><usage><m>\emptyset</m>
      </usage>
      <description>the empty set
      </description>
    </notation>.
</p>

<p>We say that <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term><idx><h>set</h><h>subset</h></idx>
  of <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\subseteq B</m><notation><usage><m>A
  \subseteq B</m>
      </usage>
    <description><m>A</m>
      is a subset of <m>B</m>
      </description>
    </notation>, if every element in the set <m>A</m> is also in the
  set <m>B</m>, and we write <m>A\not\subseteq
  B</m><notation><usage><m>A \not\subseteq B</m>
      </usage>
    <description><m>A</m>
      is not a subset of <m>B</m>
      </description>
    </notation> to
  indicate that there is at least one element in <m>A</m> that is not an
  element in <m>B</m>. A consequence of these definitions is that if 
  <m>A=B</m>, then <m>A\subseteq B</m> and <m>B\subseteq
  A</m>. Conversely, if <m>A\subseteq B</m> and <m>B\subseteq A</m>,
  then <m>A=B</m>. Another consequence is that the empty set is a subset
  of any given set <m>A</m> because there is no element
  in <m>\emptyset</m> that is not in <m>A</m>.

      <li>The expression on the right is correct. It says the object <m>2</m> is an
element of the set consisting of objects <m>1,2,3</m>. The expression on
the left is incorrect. The object <m>2</m> is not a subset of the set
consisting of objects <m>1,2,3</m>. Instead it would be correct to say
<me>\{2\}\subseteq \{1,2,3\}.</me>
</li>
      <li>      The expression on the left is correct. Since every element in the
      empty set is also an element of <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> (we say this is
      "vacuously true"), the empty set is a subset of <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>. The
      expression on the right is not correct. The set <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> has
      exactly three members, and the empty set is not one of them.
      </li>
      <li>    The last two things on the right are the same. Both symbols
    <m>\emptyset</m> and <m>\{\}</m> denote a set with no members. The two sets on
    the left are not empty: they each contain one member. But the number
    0 and the empty set are not the same thing, so two sets on the left
    are different.

	  One of the

	  true, and one example for which the statement is
	  false. "Specific" means that you will write all of the sets
	  <m>S,A,B</m> as lists of elements inside curly

Statement a is sometimes true and sometimes false. To see that statement
a is sometimes true, consider the example <m>S=A=B=\emptyset</m>.
It is clear that <m>S\setminus (A\cap B)=\emptyset = (S\setminus A)\cap
      (S\setminus B)</m>. To see that statement a
is sometimes false, consider the
example <m>S=\{a,b,c\}</m>, <m>=\{a,b\}</m>, and <m>B=\{b,c\}</m>.
Then we have
<m>S\setminus (A\cap B)=\{a,c\}</m>, but <m>(S\setminus A)\cap
  (S\setminus B)=\emptyset</m>.
  </p>
  <p>A direct proof that statement b (one of De Morgan's Law's) is always true is not required;
  proof technique for equality of sets is not expected at this
    point. A proof using characteristic functions is <xref ref="distdemorganlawsexer"/>,
  later in this text.
