The PWW looks great. I have a few ideas about it.

First, do we really need the right-hand tower? Its only purpose is to
depict the odd partial sums. I think we initially\
 regarded this as a conceptual necessity because (A) it illustrates how
 s_{2n-1} - S is the white region on the left, a\
nd (B) it illustrates how s_n ---> S.

But anyone who has the least understanding of infinite sums (i.e. our
intended audience) will be able to figure out ver\
y quickly why s_{2n-1} - S is the white region without having to look at
the right-hand tower.

Furthermore, it is clear without looking at the right-hand tower that
s_n ---> S. Here's why. S obviously a finite area\
, and the left-hand tower alone shows |S - s_n| < a_{n+1}, thus s_n --->
S.

When I cover up the right hand side of the picure, it has a vastly
greater visual impact and is much simpler.

If we did delete the right, we should change the text "S = (sum)
(shaded)" to simply "S (shaded)" to better suggest S i\
s just a number which turns out, once you examine the picture, to be the
sum. Maybe we could even move the tall bracket\
 with text "s_{2n+1} (shaded)" over to the right side of the left tower
 and change its text to "s_{2n+1} = s_2n + a_{n+\
1}"

What do you think?
