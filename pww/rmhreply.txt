David,
 
Welcome back! 
 
Not much new here.  I've been keeping a low profile because I think the
beatnik is on to me.
 
Here are my comments on the towers picture for the alternating series
proof.
 
1.  s_{2n+1}-S should be labled "white" (not "shaded," as you hand
    lettered on the hard copy)
 
2. I think the vertical axes containting the a_i's should have arrows at
   the top, pointing up to indicate the axes are number lines
 
3. I think each a_i on the vertical number lines should have a dot, or
   other tic mark.
 
4. I think we need at least one more solid shaded band below a_{2n+1} on
   the left tower to give it more visual impact.
 
5. A horizontal x-axis would anchor the picture nicely
 
6. Can the whole thing fit on one page? That would have more impact.
 
7. In the statement of the theorem, shouldn't it be a_1 >= a_2 >= a_3
   ..., rather than strict greater thans?
 
 
If you have lots of energy, it would be nice to also draw up a version
with a graph, and compare the two. Otherwise, I say let's finish up this
version and submit it. Is College Mathematics Journal OK?
