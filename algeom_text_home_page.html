  <h2>Status update 5/14/2021</h2>

  <p><em>The January 2021 edition has been classroom tested in a semester-long
      course at Lebanon Valley College. The book is now ready for
      general use. Discussion is
      welcome! Contact the author at lyons (at) lvc.edu.</em></p>

  <h2>About the Textbook</h2>

 <p>
  The purpose of this text is to take advantage of the overlap between
  introductory undergraduate mathematics courses in group theory and modern
  geometry. Beginning group theory is dominated by symmetry groups that
  are geometric in nature, and Kleinian geometry overtly places groups
  in the forefront of geometric structure in the form of congruence
  transformations. Learning the two subjects together enhances both.
</p>

 <p>
	  This free, online text is two textbooks in
   one: an introduction to group theory, and an introduction to modern
   geometries using the Kleinian paradigm. The book can be used for a
   combined one-semester course in both subjects, or, through
   supplementary projects, it can be used for a standard one-semester
   abstract algebra course or a traditional introduction to modern
   geometries course.

 </p>
  
 <p>The chapter on groups develops the basic vocabulary and theory of
 groups and homomorphisms, culminating with group
 actions. The chapter on geometry makes use of group symmetries to build
 the basic theory of MÃ¶bius, hyperbolic, elliptic, and projective
   geometries.
</p>

  <p>The text is designed for active engagement, with carefully
  structured exercises throughout.
</p>
 
 <p>The text assumes prerequisite courses in calculus, linear algebra,
   and experience with proof writing.</p>
