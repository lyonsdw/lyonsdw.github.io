<h3>Motivating Problem</h3>

An equation for a function <i>y = f(x)</i>
expresses a relationship between two variable quantities <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>.  A picture of the graph gives a visual representation of that
relationship.  To analyze a function or its graph, it can be useful to
replace the difficulties of a complicated equation and a complicated
graph with a simpler equation and a simpler graph.  One might hope that
the simpler object would be easier to understand, yet also be a
reasonable approximation to the more complicated curve.  But how do you
find such a simplification?

<h3>Observation</h3>

A <i>tangent line</i> to a curve can be thought of as a close
approximation to the curve in the vicinity of the point of tangency.
Equations and graphs of lines are easy to use.  It will turn out that
approximating a curve using its tangent line (near the point of
tangency) is a very fruitful strategy.  This leads to a geometric
problem.

<h3>Problem (refinement of the motivating problem above)</h3>

<i>Given a curve which is a piece of the graph of a function, and given
a point on the curve, how can you find the line tangent to the curve at
the given point?</i>

<h3>Illustration of a Solution</h3>

The picture in the box above illustrates a method for solving the
problem of finding a tangent line.  

<p>

The blue curve is part of the graph of a function <i>f</i>, and point
<i>P</i> is the point at which we wish to find a tangent line.

<p>

The idea is to choose another point <i>Q</i> on the graph.  It is then a
simple matter to connect <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> with a <i>secant</i>
line.  When <i>Q</i> is close to <i>P</i>, the secant line should be
close to the tangent line.  By allowing <i>Q</i> to approach <i>P</i>
and "taking a limit," we obtain the desired tangent line.  The procedure
of "taking a limit" is at the heart of calculus.  You can get a visual
idea of the process by moving the point <i>Q</i> closer and closer to
the point <i>P</i>.

<p>

The green numbers "x coord" and "y coord" give the location for
<i>Q</i>.  The blue numbers "dx" and "dy" give the horizontal and
vertical distances from <i>P</i> to <i>Q</i>, repsectively.  The magenta
number "dy/dx" is the slope of the secant line through <i>P</i> and
<i>Q</i>. 

<p>

By moving the mouse (click or click and drag), you can reposition the
vertical green line.  By moving the vertical green line closer to the
red line, the point <i>Q</i> moves closer to the basepoint <i>P</i>, and
the slope dy/dx of the secant line becomes a better approximation of the
slope of the line tangent to the blue curve at <i>P</i>.
