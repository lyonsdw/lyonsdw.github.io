  <h2>Status update 3/2/2021</h2>

  <p><em>The first edition draft is complete! We are using the book in
      a course at Lebanon Valley College during spring semester 2021,
      making edits as we go. The target date for stable online and hard
      copy editions is July 2021. Discussion is
      welcome! Contact the author at lyons (at) lvc.edu.</em></p>

  <h2>About the Textbook</h2>
  
 <p>This free, online text is designed for a one-semester undergraduate mathematics
 course that combines an introduction to group theory with an
   introduction to modern geometries using the Kleinian paradigm.
 </p>

 <p>The chapter on groups develops the basic vocabulary and theory of
 groups and homomorphisms, culminating with group
 actions. The chapter on geometry makes use of group symmetries to build
 the basic theory of MÃ¶bius, hyperbolic, elliptic, and projective
   geometries.
</p>

  <p>The text is designed for active engagement, with carefully
  structured exercises throughout.
</p>
 
 <p>The text assumes prerequisite courses in calculus, linear algebra,
   and experience with proof writing.</p>
