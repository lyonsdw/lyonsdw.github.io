	<p>These notes provide core material for an introductory
	  statistics course for second-year mathematical sciences
	  majors. This course assumes that students have had at least
	  one semester of calculus and are familiar with vocabulary,
	  notation and facts about sets and functions. Experience with
	  infinite series and convergence is desirable, but not strictly
	  required. While the course is truly introductory, in the sense
	  that no prior course in probability or statistics is assumed,
	  the title uses the term <em>intermediate</em> to indicate that
	  the level of the book is <em>between</em> a nontechnical
	  general-education text such as Freedman
	  <xref ref="freedman_statistics"/> and an upper-level
	  mathematical statistics text such as Rice
	  <xref ref="rice_math_stats"/>.
