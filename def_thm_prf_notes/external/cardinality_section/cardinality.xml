Cardinality

  <!-- Cantor Shroeder Bernstein Theorem -->

  <section>
    <title>More vocabulary and notation</title>
<p>    We say that sets <m>A,B</m> are <term>equipotent</term>,
  denoted <m>A\sim B</m>, if they have the same cardinality. By Theorem
  7.1.3 in <xref ref="chapterzero"/>, equipotence is an equivalence
  relation. Given a set <m>A</m>, we write <m>|A|</m>, pronounced
  <q>the cardinality of the set <m>A</m></q>, to denote the
  equivalence class of <m>A</m> with respect to <m>\sim</m>. Note that
  this usage is consistent with the notation <q><m>|S|=n</m></q>
  for a finite set <m>S</m> of size <m>n</m>, where <m>n</m> is a nonnegative integer.
</p>

<exercise>
  <p>Explain what it means to say that the notation <q><m>|A|</m></q>
    for the equipotence class of the set <m>A</m> is <q>consistent</q>
    with the notation for the size of a finite set.

  <section><title>Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem</title>

  <theorem><title>(Schroeder-Bernstein)</title>
    <statement>If <m>f\colon A\to B</m> and <m>g\colon B\to A</m> are
one-to-one maps, then <m>A\sim B</m>.
    </statement>
  </theorem>



  <p><alert>Proof outline.</alert>
    <ol>
      <li>For each <m>a\in A</m>, form a sequence to the right and to the left of
  <m>a</m>.
<me>\cdots \to g^{-1}(f^{-1}(g^{-1}(a))) \to f^{-1}(g^{-1}(a)) \to g^{-1}(a) \to a \to f(a) \to g(f(a)) \to f(g(f(a))) \to \cdots
</me>
      </li>
      <li>Observe that theses sequences may or may not terminate on the left.
      </li>
      <li>Observe that each of these sequences is one of two types: (i) terminates on the left with an
  element <m>y\in B</m> (that is, <m>y</m> is not in the image of <m>f</m>); or (ii)
  does not have the property that defines type (i).
      </li>
      <li>Define <m>h\colon A\to B</m> by <m>h(a)=g^{-1}(a)</m>
	if <m>a</m> lies in a sequence of type (i), and <m>h(a) =
	f(a)</m> if <m>a</m> lies in a sequence of type (ii). Now show
	<m>h</m> is well-defined and is a bijection.
      </li>
    </ol>
