  Logic
</title>

<introduction>

  <p>  Logic is the study of the formal structure of reasoning. In
mathematical sciences, we use logic to construct arguments, and also to
read analyze the validity of arguments.
</p>

  <p>
    In this course we consider a traditional and standard version of logic,
    which has the following basic ingredients.
    <ul>
      <li><alert>statements:</alert> declarative sentences that claim something
  is true
      </li>
      <li><alert>two truth values: </alert> every statement must be unambiguously <term>true</term>
    or <term>false</term>, but not both
      </li>
      <li><alert>connectives:</alert> statements can be combined with
	logical
	connectives <term>not</term>, <term>and</term>, <term>or</term>, <term>if-then</term>, and
	others, to form new statements
      </li>
      <li><alert>rules of reasoning:</alert> these are rules for establishing
        the truth of statements based on an established sequence of true statements
      </li>
    </ul>
We will follow the usual approach used in introductory proof writing
courses that relies on intuition, rather than a formal axiomatic
treatment of logic.

<subsection>
  <title>Boolean algebra</title>
</subsection>

<p>The truth tables for compound statements that are presented in most
  textbooks are just input-output tables for functions, where every
  entry is a truth value. In these tables, the actual statements play no
  role; only their truth values matter. Boolean algebra provides a
  language for working directly with such functions in a way that
  bypasses the need for cumbersome input-output tables.</p>

<p>The set <m>\B=\{0,1\}</m>, together with the operations of addition and
multiplication mod 2, is called the <term>Boolean domain</term>. Multiplication
mod 2 is the same as ordinary multiplication of integers. Addition mod 2
is defined by <m>0+0=0</m>, <m>1+0=0+1=1</m>, and <m>1+1=0</m>.
</p>
<exercise>

<statement>  <p>Show that the following identities hold for <m>x,y,z\in \B</m>.
  <ol>
    <li><m>x+y=y+x</m> (the commutative law of addition)</li>
    <li><m>xy=yx</m>
       (the commutative law of multiplication)</li>
    <li><m>x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z</m>
       (the associative law of addition)</li>
    <li><m>x(yz)=(xy)z</m>
       (the associative law of multiplication)</li>
    <li><m>x+0 = 0+x = x</m>
       (additive identity)</li>
    <li><m>x1 = 1x = x</m>
       (multiplicative identity)  </li>
    <li><m>x(y+z) = xy+xz</m>
       (the distributive law)</li>
    <li><m>x^2=x</m>
      </li>
    <li><m>(x+y)^2=x+y</m>
      </li>
    <li><m>x(x+1)=0</m>
      </li>
  </ol></p>
</statement>
</exercise>

<p>  Let <m>\mathcal{S}</m>
   denote the set of all statements, and let <m>v\colon  \mathcal{S} \to \B</m>
   given by
  <me>v(p) = \begin{cases}
    1 \amp \text{ if } p \text{ is true}\\
    0 \amp \text{ if } p \text{ is false}.
    \end{cases}</me>
</p>
  
  <exercise>
    <statement><p>
	Let <m>p,q\in \mathcal{S}</m>.
	<ol>
	  <li>Show that <m>v(\sim p) = v(p)+1</m>.
	  </li>
	  <li>Show that <m>v(p\wedge q) = v(p)v(q)</m>.
	  </li>
	  <li>Show that <m>v(p\vee q) = v(p)+v(q)+v(p)v(q)</m>.
	  </li>	  
	</ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <p>The exercise above justifies the following associations.
    <me>\begin{array}{c|c}
      \text{logical connective} \amp \text{Boolean function}\\ \hline
      \sim \amp x \to x+1\\
      \wedge \amp (x,y) \to xy\\
      \vee \amp (x,y) \to x+y+xy
      \end{array}</me>
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <statement><p>
	Let <m>\oplus</m> denote the logical connective whose
	corresponding Boolean function is <m>(x,y)\to x+y</m>. Use a
	truth table to verify that a reasonable verbalization
	of <q><m>p \oplus q</m></q>
	is <q><m>p</m> or <m>q</m>,
	  but not both</q>. The connective <m>\oplus</m> is
	called <term>exclusive or</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  
  <exercise>
    <statement><p>
	Find the missing Boolean functions for the logical connectives in the
	table below.
    <me>\begin{array}{c|c}
      \text{logical connective} \amp \text{Boolean function}\\ \hline
      \Rightarrow \amp  \\
      \Leftrightarrow \amp 
      \end{array}</me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <!--
  <p>
A function <m>f\colon \mathcal{S}^n\to \mathcal{S}</m> is
called <em>logical</em> if there is a function <m>g\colon \B^n \to
  \B</m> so
that <m>g(v(p_1),v(p_1),\ldots,v(p_n))=v(f(p_1,p_1,\ldots,p_n))</m> for
all <m>n</m>-tuples of statements <m>p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n</m>.
</p>

    facts: every logical connective has a Boolean function

    every Boolean function <m>f\colon \B^n \to \B</m>
    in n variables is expressible as a polynomial
       <m>\sum_I c_I x_1^{i_1}x_2^{i_2}\cdots x_n^{i_n}</m> where
     <m>I=i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_n</m> is a bit string
