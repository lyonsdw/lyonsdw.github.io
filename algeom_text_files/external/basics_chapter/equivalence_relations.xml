    <title>Definitions</title>

    <p>A relation on a set <m>X</m> is a subset
      of <m>X\times X</m>. Given a relation <m>R\subseteq X\times X</m>,
      we write <m>x\sim_R y</m>, or just <m>x\sim y</m> if <m>R</m> is
      understood by context, to denote that <m>(x,y)\in R</m>. A
      relation is <term>reflexive</term> if <m>x\sim x</m> for
      every <m>x</m> in <m>X</m>. A
      relation is <term>symmetric</term> if <m>x\sim y</m>
      implies <m>y\sim x</m>. A
      relation is <term>transitive</term> if <m>x\sim y</m> and
      <m>y\sim z </m> together imply that <m>x\sim z</m>. A relation is
      called an <term>equivalence relation</term><idx>equivalence relation</idx>
      if it is reflexive,
      symmetric, and transitive. Given an equivalence relation
      on <m>X</m> and an element <m>x\in X</m>, we write <m>[x]</m> to
      denote the set
      <men xml:id="equivalenceclass">
	[x] = \{y\in X\colon x\sim y\},
      </men>
      <idx><h>equivalence class</h></idx>
	<notation><usage><m>[x]</m></usage><description>the equivalence class
	    of an element <m>x</m></description></notation>
      called the <term>equivalence class</term> of the
      element <m>x</m>. The set of equivalence classes is
      denoted <m>X/\!\!\sim</m>, that is,
      <men xml:id="setofequivclasses">     
	X/\!\!\sim \; = \{[x]\colon x\in X\}.</men>

<p>    Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. Let <m>\sim_n</m> be the relation on
    the integers <m>\Z</m><notation><usage><m>\Z</m></usage><description>the
      integers</description></notation> given by
    <me>x\sim_n y \Leftrightarrow n|(x-y)</me>
    (recall that the symbols <q><m>a|b</m></q>
     for integers <m>a,b</m>,
    pronounced <q><m>a</m> divides <m>b</m></q>, means <m>b=ka</m> for some
    integer <m>k</m>). It is easy to show that <m>\sim_n</m> is an
    equivalence relation, and that the equivalence classes are precisely
    the set
    <me>\Z/\!\!\sim_n = \{[0],[1],[2],\ldots,[n-1]\}.</me>
  This set of equivalence classes is fundamental and pervasive in
    mathematics. Using standard notation, we write
    <me>x=y \hspace{-.5em}\pmod{n}</me>
    (pronounced <q><m>x</m> is equivalent to <m>y</m> mod <m>n</m></q>) to
    denote <q><m>x\sim_n y</m></q>. In this text, we will follow the common practice
    of using <m>\Z_n</m> to denote <m>\Z/\!\!\sim_n</m>.

	  <p> Let <m>X</m> be a set. Equivalence
      relations on <m>X</m> and partitions of <m>X</m> are in one-to-one
      correspondence, as follows.
	     Given an equivalence
	    relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m>, the collection
	    <me>X/\!\!\sim \; = \{[x]\colon x\in X\}</me>
	    is a partition of <m>X</m>. Conversely, given a
	    partition <m>{\mathcal P}</m>
	    of <m>X</m>, the relation <m>\sim_{\mathcal P}</m> defined by
	    <me>
x\sim_{\mathcal P} y \Leftrightarrow x,y \text{ lie in the same element of } {\mathcal P}
	    </me> is an equivalence relation. These
	    correspondences are inverse to one another. That is,

	    <p>A key component of the Fact <xref ref="equivrelpart"/> is

	    <p>It suffices to show that <m>[x]\cap [y]\neq \emptyset</m>
	      implies that <m>[x]=[y]</m>. Suppose that <m>[x]\cap
	      [y]\neq \emptyset</m>, so that there is some
	      element <m>z\in X</m> that lies in <m>[x]\cap [y]</m>. Suppose
	      further that some element <m>w\in X</m> lies
	      in <m>[x]</m>. Then we have <m>w\sim x</m>, <m>x\sim
		z</m>, and <m>z\sim y</m>. It follows from transitivity
	      that <m>w\sim y</m>, so we have <m>w\in
		[y]</m>. Since <m>w</m> was arbitrary, we have shown
	      that <m>[x]\subseteq [y]</m>. The same argument, reversing the
	    roles of <m>x,y</m>, shows that <m>[y]\subseteq [x]</m>. We
	      conclude that <m>[x]=[y]</m>, as desired.

	      <li>Reflexivity and symmetry of <m>\sim</m>
		are clear by inspection. To
		show transitivity, suppose <m>(m,n)\sim (m',n')</m>
		and <m>(m',n')\sim (m'',n'')</m>, so we have
		<m>mn'=m'n</m> and <m>m'n''=m''n'</m>. Multiplying left

		<me>mn'm'n''=m'nm''n'</me>
		which is the same as
		<me>(mn'')(m'n')=(m''n)(m'n').\hspace{1in}(\ast)</me>
		If <m>m'n'=0</m>, then we must have <m>m'=0</m>
		(because <m>n'\neq 0</m> by assumption), so we must also
		have <m>m=m''=0</m>. If <m>m'n'\neq 0</m>, then we may

		have <m>mn''=m''n</m>. In all cases, we

		desired. Alternatively, you can jump ahead to the
		punch line and see that <m>(m,n)\sim (m',n')</m> if and
