      <li>Integers <m>x,n</m> are relatively prime if and only
	if <m>\gcd(x,n)=1</m>, if and only if there exist
	integers <m>s,t</m> such that <m>sx+tn=1</m> (see <xref ref="subgpsofzexer"/>), if and only
	if <m>sx=1 \pmod{n}</m>.
      </li>
      <li>Multiplication is a well-defined binary operation
      on <m>\Z_n</m> (see <xref ref="intmodnmult"/>) that is
	clearly commutative and associative. The element <m>1\in U_n</m>
      is the identity element, and the existence of inverse elements is
	part of the definition of <m>U_n</m>.
      </li>
      <li>Let <m>f\colon \Z_n\to \Z_n</m> be a group homomorphism, and
	let <m>a=f(1)</m>. Then
	<me>f(x) = f(\underbrace{1+1+\cdots	  +1}_{x \text{ summands}})=xf(1)=ax</me>
	for all <m>x</m>. The homomorphism <m>\mu_a\colon
	  \Z_n\to\Z_n</m> given by <m>\mu_a(x)=ax</m> is invertible if
	and only if <m>a\in U_n</m> (if <m>a\not\in U_n</m>,
	then <m>1</m> is not in the image of <m>\mu_a</m>, and
	conversely if <m>a\in U_n</m>, then <m>\mu_a</m> is invertible
	with inverse <m>(\mu_a)^{-1}=\mu_{a^{1}}</m>). Thus we have a one-to-one
	correspondence <m>U_n\leftrightarrow \Aut(\Z_n)</m> given
	by <m>a\leftrightarrow \mu_a</m>. The fact that <m>(ab)x = a(bx)</m>
verifies that <m>\mu_a\circ \mu_b=\mu_{ab}</m>, so the
	correspondence <m>a\leftrightarrow \mu_a</m> is an isomorphism

      <statement>
	<p>This exercise gives a way to define even and odd
	      permutations that is different from the method used in

	  <ol><li>Suppose that the identity permutation <m>e</m>

	  are either both even or both odd. The common evenness or

      <hint><p><ol><li>Consider the two rightmost

      <!-- <p>First we prove a technical Lemma: Let <m>n\geq 2</m>. Given <m>a\in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}</m> and
	given transpositions <m>\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_k</m>
	in <m>S_n</m>, define <m>h(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k,a)</m> to be
	the highest index <m>\ell</m> such that <m>a</m> appears
	in <m>\alpha_\ell</m>, and
	let <m>h(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k,a)=0</m> if <m>a</m> does not
	appear in any <m>\alpha_i</m>. Now
	let <m>\tau_1,\tau_2,\ldots,\tau_r</m> be transpositions
	in <m>S_n</m> for some <m>r\geq 2</m>.
	  Then there exist transpositions <m>\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_t</m> such
	  that <m>\tau_1\tau_2\cdots \tau_r=\beta_1\beta_2\cdots
	  \beta_t</m>, such that <m>r,t</m> have the same parity, and 
	such that <m>h(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_t,a)</m> is equal to 0
	or 1.
	We prove the Lemma by induction on the value of <m>h</m>. The Lemma's assertion clearly holds
	if <m>h=0</m> or if <m>h=1</m>. Now suppose the Lemma's assertion holds for
	all <m>h\lt s</m>, and now
	suppose <m>h(\tau_1,\tau_2,\ldots,\tau_r,a)=s</m> for
	some <m>\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_r,a</m>. 
	The four possibilities
	for <m>\tau_{s-1}\tau_s</m> (note that we may assume <m>s\geq 2</m>)
	are the following,
	where <m>a,b,c,d</m> are distinct.
<mdn><mrow xml:id="groupdeflocaltag1" tag="star"> (ab)(ab), (ac)(ab), (bc)(ab),
    (cd)(ab) </mrow></mdn>	
	    These products can be rewritten, respectively, as the following.
<mdn><mrow xml:id="groupdeflocaltag2" tag="dstar"> e, (ab)(bc), (ac)(cb), (ab)(cd) </mrow></mdn>		    
	    In the first of the four cases in
	    <xref ref="groupdeflocaltag1"/>, where <m>\tau_{s-1}\tau_s=(ab)(ab)</m>, we have
	    <me>\tau_1\tau_2\cdots\tau_{s-1}\tau_s\cdots
	    \tau_r=\tau_1\tau_2\cdots\widehat{\tau}_{s-1}\widehat{\tau}_s
	      \cdots \tau_r</me>
	    where <m>h(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_{s-2},\tau_{s+1},\ldots,\tau_r,a)\leq
	    s-2</m>, and the number of transpositions on both sides
	    differs by 2.
	    By the inductive hypothesis, the Lemma's assertion holds. In
	    each of the three remaining cases in <xref ref="groupdeflocaltag1"/>, we can write
	    <me>\tau_1\tau_2\cdots\tau_{s-1}\tau_s\cdots
	    \tau_r=\tau_1\tau_2\cdots{\tau}'_{s-1}{\tau}'_s
	      \cdots \tau_r</me>	    
where <m>h(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau'_{s-1},\tau'_s,\ldots,\tau_r,a)\leq s-1</m>. Once again, the Lemma's
	    assertion follows by the inductive hypothesis. This
	    completes the proof of the Lemma.
	</p>-->
	<p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Clearly, <m>r</m> cannot be 1, and the statement is true
	    for <m>r=2</m>. Now suppose the statement holds for <m>k\lt
	      r</m> and let <m>e=\tau_1\cdots \tau_r</m> be
	    given. The four possibilities
	    for <m>\tau_{r-1}\tau_r</m> are the following,
	    where <m>a,b,c,d</m> are distinct.
	    <me>(ab)(ab), (ac)(ab), (bc)(ab), (cd)(ab)</me>
	    These products can be rewritten, respectively, as
	    <me>e, (ab)(bc), (ac)(cb), (ab)(cd)</me>
	    In the first case, we have <m>e=\tau_1\cdots \tau_{r-2}</m>,
	    so <m>r-2</m> must be even by the inductive hypothesis, so
	    we are done. In the other three cases, we have an expression
	    where the rightmost occurrence of the symbol <m>a</m> is in
	    position <m>r-1</m>. Continuing this process, we continue to
	    rewrite the product of transpositions until the number of
	    transpositions drops by 2. This must happen, because
	    otherwise the rightmost occurrence of the symbol <m>a</m>
	    would be in the first transposition, but then the product
	    would not be the identity because it would not fix <m>a</m>.

	  so <m>s+t</m> is even by the previous part.

	  <li>A <m>k</m>-cycle is a product of <m>k-1</m> transpositions.

	  for all <m>v_1,v_2,x\in \R^2</m> and <m>g_1,g_2\in O(2)</m>.

	  homomorphism on <m>K</m>, for all <m>h\in H</m>). Show

      <li><p> Check the following.
      <ul>
	  <li>the identity element is <m>(e_K,e_H)</m> </li>
	  <li><m>(k,h)^{-1}=(\phi(h^{-1})(k^{-1}),h^{-1})</m>
	  </li>
	  <li>associativity holds: either order of multiplication gives
	    <me>(k_1,h_1)(k_2,h_2)(k_3,h_3)=(k_1[\phi(h_1)(k_2)][\phi(h_1h_2)(k_3)],h_1h_2h_3)</me>
      </li>
	</ul>
      </p></li>
      <li>First, note that <m>\phi(h)=C_h</m> does indeed map <m>K</m>
	to itself because <m>K</m> is normal, that <m>C_h</m> is
	indeed an automorphism because <m>(C_h)^{-1}=C_{h^{-1}}</m>, and
	that <m>\phi</m> is indeed a homomorphism
	because <m>C_{hh'}=C_hC_{h'}</m>. To see that <m>\psi</m> is a
	homomorphism, we have the following.
	<md>
	  <mrow>\psi((k,h),(k',h')) \amp = \psi (khk'h^{-1},hh')</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = khk'h^{-1}hh'</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = khk'h'</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = \psi((k,h))\psi((k',h'))</mrow>
	</md>
	The assumption that <m>G=KH</m> implies that <m>\psi</m> is
	onto. If <m>e=\psi((k,h))=kh</m>, then <m>k=h^{-1}</m>, so <m>k\in
	  H</m> and <m>h\in K</m>. The assumption <m>K\cap H=\{e\}</m>
	implies <m>k=h=e</m>. We conclude that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one.
      </li>
      <li><p>We apply the previous part
	to <m>K=\langle R_{1/n}\rangle\approx C_n, H=\langle
	F_L\rangle\approx C_2</m>,
	where <m>L</m> is any one of the lines of symmetry of the
	<m>n</m>-gon. Because <m>K</m> is Abelian, the rotation group <m>K</m>
	is normal in <m>D_n</m>. To see that <m>D_n=KH</m>, 
	first, we confirm that <m>D_n=\langle R_{1/n},F_L\rangle</m>. To see why, 
	verify the relations
	<md>
	  <mrow>R^{-1}=FRF</mrow>
	  <mrow>F_{R(L)}=RF_LR^{-1}</mrow>
	</md>
	which hold for any
	rotation <m>R</m> and any reflection <m>F</m>. Now, given any
	string of <m>R</m>'s (for various angles) and <m>F</m>'s, first
	rewrite all the <m>F</m>'s in the form <m>RF_LR^{-1}</m>, then
	apply <m>F_LR=R^{-1}F_L</m> to shift all the <m>R</m>'s to the
	left and all the <m>F_L</m>'s to the right. This shows that any element
	in <m>D_n</m> can be written in the form <m>R_\theta F_L^a</m>
	for some <m>\theta</m> and <m>a=0,1</m>. Finally, it is clear
	that we have <m>K\cap H=\{R_0\}</m>. The hypothesis of the
	result in the previous part are met, so we conclude that <m>D_n
	  \approx K\rtimes H \approx C_n\rtimes C_2</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
	We can also see the semidirect product structure directly,
	without using the result from the previous part. From what we
	have shown, multiplication in <m>D_n</m> looks like this.
	<md>
	  <mrow> (R_\theta F_L^a)(R_\phi F_L^b)
	  \amp = R_\theta F_L^aR_\phi (F_L^a F_L^a) F_L^b</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = R_\theta (F_L^aR_\phi F_L^a) F_L^a F_L^b</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = R_\theta R_{(-1)^a\phi}F_L^{a+b}</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = R_{\theta+(-1)^a\phi}F_L^{a+b}</mrow>
	</md>
	This last expression is the same as the multiplication given by
	the semidirect product.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li> We have the following.
	<md>
	  <mrow>[(v_1,g_1)(v_2,g_2)]x \amp = [(v_1+g_1v_2,g_1g_2)]x   </mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = g_1g_2x + v_1+g_1v_2</mrow>
	  <mrow>\amp = g_1(g_2x+v_2) + v_1</mrow>
	  <mrow>	  \amp = (v_1,g_1)[(v_2,g_2)x]</mrow>
	</md>
      </li>
      <li>This is clear by inspection.</li>
