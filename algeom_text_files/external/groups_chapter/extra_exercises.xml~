      <li>Integers <m>x,n</m> are relatively prime if and only
	if <m>\gcd(x,n)=1</m>, if and only if there exist
	integers <m>s,t</m> such that <m>sx+tn=1</m> (see <xref ref="subgpsofzexer"/>), if and only
	if <m>sx=1 \pmod{n}</m>.
      </li>
      <li>Multiplication is a well-defined binary operation
      on <m>\Z_n</m> (see <xref ref="intmodnmult"/>) that is
	clearly commutative and associative. The element <m>1\in U_n</m>
      is the identity element, and the existence of inverse elements is
	part of the definition of <m>U_n</m>.
      </li>
      <li>Let <m>f\colon \Z_n\to \Z_n</m> be a group homomorphism, and
	let <m>a=f(1)</m>. Then
	<me>f(x) = f(\underbrace{1+1+\cdots	  +1}_{x \text{ summands}})=xf(1)=ax</me>
	for all <m>x</m>. The homomorphism <m>\mu_a\colon
	  \Z_n\to\Z_n</m> given by <m>\mu_a(x)=ax</m> is invertible if
	and only if <m>a\in U_n</m> (if <m>a\not\in U_n</m>,
	then <m>1</m> is not in the image of <m>\mu_a</m>, and
	conversely if <m>a\in U_n</m>, then <m>\mu_a</m> is invertible
	with inverse <m>(\mu_a)^{-1}=\mu_{a^{1}}</m>). Thus we have a one-to-one
	correspondence <m>U_n\leftrightarrow \Aut(\Z_n)</m> given
	by <m>a\leftrightarrow \mu_a</m>. The fact that <m>(ab)x = a(bx)</m>
verifies that <m>\mu_a\circ \mu_b=\mu_{ab}</m>, so the

    Let <m>\tau</m> be a transposition (<m>\tau=(12)</m> will do

  </li>
  <li>It is clear that the product of two even permutations is an even
    permutation. If <m>\sigma=\tau_1\cdots \tau_r</m> is a product of

  <p>Just observe that the order of a <m>k</m>-cycle is <m>k</m>. Now if
    <m>\sigma=\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_r</m> is a factoring of <m>\sigma</m>
    into a product of disjoint cycles <m>\alpha_i</m>, we have
    <m>\sigma^s=\alpha_1^s\cdots\alpha_r^s</m>
    so if <m>\sigma^s=e</m> it must be that <m>s</m> is a multiple
    of the length of each of the <m>\alpha_i</m>. By the definition of

      <li>First, note that <m>\phi(h)=C_h</m> does indeed map <m>K</m>

	indeed an automorphism because <m>(C_h)^{-1}=C_{h^{-1}}</m>, and
	that <m>\phi</m> is indeed a homomorphism
	because <m>C_{hh'}=C_hC_{h'}</m>. To see that <m>\psi</m> is a

	  <mrow>\amp = \psi((k,h))\psi((k',h'))</mrow>

	The assumption that <m>G=KH</m> implies that <m>\psi</m> is
	onto. If <m>e=\psi((k,h))=kh</m>, then <m>k=h^{-1}</m>, so <m>k\in

	implies <m>k=h=e</m>. We conclude that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one.
      </li>
      <li><p>We apply the previous part

	F_L\rangle\approx C_2</m>,
	where <m>L</m> is any one of the lines of symmetry of the
	<m>n</m>-gon. Because <m>K</m> is Abelian, the rotation group <m>K</m>
	is normal in <m>D_n</m>. To see that <m>D_n=KH</m>, 
	first, we confirm that <m>D_n=\langle R_{1/n},F_L\rangle</m>. To see why, 
	verify the relations
	<md>
	  <mrow>R^{-1}=FRF</mrow>
	  <mrow>F_{R(L)}=RF_LR^{-1}</mrow>
	</md>
	which hold for any
	rotation <m>R</m> and any reflection <m>F</m>. Now, given any
	string of <m>R</m>'s (for various angles) and <m>F</m>'s, first
	rewrite all the <m>F</m>'s in the form <m>RF_LR^{-1}</m>, then
	apply <m>F_LR=R^{-1}F_L</m> to shift all the <m>R</m>'s to the
	left and all the <m>F_L</m>'s to the right. This shows that any element
	in <m>D_n</m> can be written in the form <m>R_\theta F_L^a</m>
	for some <m>\theta</m> and <m>a=0,1</m>. Finally, it is clear
	that we have <m>K\cap H=\{R_0\}</m>. The hypothesis of the
	result in the previous part are met, so we conclude that <m>D_n
	  \approx K\rtimes H \approx C_n\rtimes C_2</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
	We can also see the semidirect product structure directly,
	without using the result from the previous part. From what we
	have shown, multiplication in <m>D_n</m> looks like this.
	<md>
	  <mrow> (R_\theta F_L^a)(R_\phi F_L^b)
	  \amp = R_\theta F_L^aR_\phi (F_L^a F_L^a) F_L^b</mrow>

	  <mrow>\amp = R_{\theta+(-1)^a\phi}F_L^{a+b}</mrow>
	</md>
	This last expression is the same as the multiplication given by
	the semidirect product.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li> We have the following.
	<md>
	  <mrow>[(v_1,g_1)(v_2,g_2)]x \amp = [(v_1+g_1v_2,g_1g_2)]x   </mrow>

  <title>Instructor's solution for <xref ref="gpactonfunspaceexer"/></title>
  <p>We wish to show that the map <m>G\to \Perm({\mathcal F}(X,Y))</m> given
    by
    <m>g\to [\alpha\to \alpha\circ g^{-1}]</m> is a homomorphism.
Indeed, for <m>g,h\in G</m> and <m>\alpha\in {\mathcal F}(X,Y)</m>, we have
    <me>(gh)\alpha = \alpha\circ (gh)^{-1}= \alpha\circ (h^{-1}g^{-1})
    = (\alpha\circ h^{-1})\circ g^{-1}=g(h(\alpha)).</me>
  </p>
