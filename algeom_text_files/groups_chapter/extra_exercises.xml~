		<title><term>Fermat's Little Theorem</term>
		</title><idx>Fermat's Little Theorem</idx> <p>
		  For every integer <m>x</m> and every prime <m>p</m>,
		  we have <m>x^p = x \pmod{p}</m>. <hint>First,
		    reduce <m>x</m> mod <m>p</m>, that is,
		    write <m>x=qp+r</m> with <m>0\leq r\leq p-1</m>. Now
		    consider two cases. The case <m>r=0</m> is
		    trivial. If <m>r\neq 0</m>, apply the
		  fact <m>r^{|G|}=e</m> (see <xref ref="lagrangeconseqexer"/>) to the group <m>G=U_p</m>.

  <title>Semidirect product</title>
  <idx>semidirect product of groups</idx>
  <statement><p>
      Let <m>K,H</m> be groups, and let <m>\phi\colon H\to \Aut(K)</m>
      be a homomorphism. The <term>semidirect product</term>,
      denoted <m>K\times_{\phi} H</m>, or <m>K\rtimes H</m>
      if <m>\phi</m> is understood, is the set consisting of all
      pairs <m>(k,h)</m> with <m>k\in K</m>, <m>h\in H</m><fn>The
	notation <m>K\times H</m> is understood to be
      the <em>direct</em> product group, so we do not write use the Cartesian product
      notation to describe semidirect product, to avoid confusion, even
      though the underlying set for the direct product and the
	semidirect product are in fact the same Cartesian
      product <m>K\times H</m>.</fn> with the group multiplication
      operation <m>\ast</m>
      given by
      <me>(k_1,h_1)\ast (k_1,h_2) = (k_1\phi(h_1)(k_2),h_1h_2).</me> Two
      examples demonstrate why this is a useful construction. The
      dihedral group <m>D_n</m> is (isomorhpic to) the semidirect
      product <m>C_n\rtimes C_2</m>, where <m>C_n</m> is the cyclic
      group generated by the rotation <m>R_{1/n}</m> (rotation
      by <m>1/n</m> of a revolution) and <m>C_2</m> is the two-element
      group generated by any reflection <m>R_L</m> in <m>D_n</m>. The
      map <m>\phi\colon C_2 \to \Aut(C_n)</m> is given by <m>F_L \to
	[R_{\theta} \to R_{-\theta}]</m>. The <em>Euclidean group</em>
      of congruence transformations of the plane is (isomorphic to) the
      group <m>\R^2\rtimes O(2)</m>, where <m>(\R^2,+)</m> is the
      additive group of <m>2\times 1</m> column vectors with real
      entries, and <m>O(2)</m> is the group of <m>2\times 2</m> real
      orthogonal matrices. The map <m>\phi\colon O(2)\to \Aut(\R^2)</m>
      is given by <m>g\to [v\to gv]</m>, that is to say, the natural
      action of <m>O(2)</m> on <m>\R^2</m>. [The Euclidean group
      element <m>(g,v)</m> acts on the point <m>x\in\R^2</m> by <m>x\to
	gx+v</m>.]
      <ol>
	<li>Do all the necessary details to show that <m>K\rtimes H</m>
	is indeed a group.
	</li>
	<li>Show that <m>D_n\approx C_n\rtimes C_2</m>, as described above.
	</li>
	<li>Suppose that <m>\phi\colon H\to \Aut(K)</m> is the trivial
	  homomorphism (that is, <m>\phi(h)</m> is the identity
	  homomorphism on <m>K</m>, for all <m>h\in H</m>). Show
	  that <m>K\times_{\phi} H\approx K\times H</m> in this case.

  <idx>exact sequence of group homomorphisms</idx>
  <idx>short exact sequence of group homomorphisms</idx>
  <idx>splitting of a short exact sequence</idx>    
  <statement><p>
      A sequence of groups and homomorphisms
      <me>\cdots \underset{f_{i-2}}{\longrightarrow} G_{i-1}
	\underset{f_{i-1}}{\longrightarrow} G_{i}
	\underset{f_{i}}{\longrightarrow} G_{i+1}
	\underset{f_{i+1}}{\longrightarrow}\cdots
      </me>
      is <term>exact</term> if <m>\ker(f_{i})=\im(f_{i-1})</m> for
      all <m>i</m>. A <term>short exact sequence</term> of groups and
      homomorphisms is an exact sequence of the form
      <me>1\to K\to G\to H\to 1</me>
      where <m>1</m> denotes the trivial group. A short exact sequence
            <men xml:id="SES">1{\to} K \underset{i}{\longrightarrow} G \underset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} H\to 1</men>
	    is said to <m>split</m> if there is a group
	    homomorphism <m>s\colon H\to G</m> such that <m>\pi\circ
	      s</m> is the identity homomorphism on <m>H</m>.
	    <ol>
	      <li>Show that for a short exact sequence of the form
		<xref ref="SES"/>, that the homomorphism <m>i</m> is
		one-to-one, the homomorphism <m>\pi</m> is onto,
		and <m>G/K\approx H</m>.
	      </li>
	      <li>Suppose that <xref ref="SES"/> splits, with
		splitting <m>s\colon H\to G</m>. Show
		that <m>\phi\colon H\to \Aut(K)</m> given by
		<me>\phi(h)(k) =
		i^{-1}\left(f(h)i(k)f(h)^{-1}\right)</me> is defined and is
		a homomorphism.
	      </li>
	      <li>Show that the short exact sequence <xref ref="SES"/>
		splits, with splitting <m>s</m>,
		if and only
		if <m>G\approx K\times_{\phi} H</m>, where <m>\phi</m>
		is described in the previous part above.
