      <p>blah blah blah verbiage here with some motivation for single
	elliptic geometry</p>
      
      <p>Let <m>\sim_d</m> be the equivalence relation on <m>S^2</m>
      defined by declaring endpoints of diameters to be identified, that
	is, <m>P\sim_d (-P)</m> for every point <m>P</m>
	on <m>S^2</m>. Because any rotation <m>R</m> in <m>\Rot(S^2)</m>
      carries every pair of diameter endpoints to another pair of
	diameter endpoints, <m>\Rot(S^2)</m> acts on the set of
	equivalence classes <m>S^2/\!\!\sim_d</m>. The 
	pair <m>(S^2/\!\!\sim_d,\Rot(S^2))</m> is called <term>spherical
      model</term><idx><h>single elliptic
	    geometry</h><h>spherical model</h></idx> for single elliptic geometry. We
	  say that <m>z,w</m> in <m>\extC</m> are endpoints of diameters
	  if <m>s^{-1}(z),s^{-1}(w)</m> are endpoints of diameters
	  on <m>S^2</m>. This turns out to be the same as the condition
	that <m>z,w</m> are symmetric with respect to the unit circle
	(see <xref ref="stereoprojdiamends"/>).
	Identifying endpoints of diameters
	  in <m>\extC</m>, using the same notation <m>\sim_d</m>, leads to
	the <term>extended plane model</term><idx><h>single elliptic
      geometry</h><h>extended plane model</h>
	</idx>
	<m>(\extC/\!\!\sim_d,\S)</m> for single elliptic
	geometry. 
	For each pair of diameter endpoints in <m>\extC</m>,
	  at least one of them will be in the <em>closed</em> unit
	    disk <m>\closedD=\{z\in\C\colon |z|\leq 1\}</m>. We define
	  an equivalence relation on <m>\closedD</m>, once again
	called <m>\sim_d</m>, by identifying <m>z,-z</m> for <m>|z|=1</m>.
	  There is a bijection <m>\extC\sim_d\leftrightarrow
	  \closedD/\!\!\sim_d</m>. The pair <m>(\closedD/\!\!\sim_d,\S)</m> is called
	the <term>disk model</term><idx><h>single elliptic geometry</h><h>disk
	model</h>
	</idx> for single elliptic geometry.
