        <title>Preface</title>

 <p>
  The purpose of this text is to take advantage of the overlap between
  introductory courses in group theory and modern geometry. Group theory
  typically features geometric content in the form of symmetry groups,
  and Kleinian geometry relies on the group structure of congruence
  transformations. Learning the two subjects together enhances
  both.
  <!--Because each course will inevitably cover some of the content
  of the other, there is also an efficiency realized by putting them
  together. -->
</p>

 <p>
	  This text is two textbooks in
   one: an introduction to group theory, and an introduction to modern
   geometries using the Kleinian paradigm. The book can be used for a
   combined one-semester course in both subjects, or, through
   supplementary projects, it can be used for a one-semester
   introduction to group theory or a one-semester introduction to modern
   geometries.

 </p>

 <p>The chapter on groups develops the basic vocabulary and theory of
 groups and homomorphisms, culminating with group
 actions. The chapter on geometry makes use of group symmetries to build
 the basic theory of Möbius, hyperbolic, elliptic, and projective
 geometries. Throughout, a design theme is the use of a small but
 carefully chosen collection of tools, beginning with the algebra and
 geometry of complex numbers and quaternions, and using a minimum of
 machinery from analysis and linear algebra, to develop useful and
 nontrivial results for group theory and geometry in a way that prefers
 using conceptual tools to brute computation.
</p>

 <p>Many results (for example, Lagrange's Theorem for groups and
 area formulas in hyperbolic and elliptic geometries) are developed
 in carefully structured exercises, rather than in the reading. This
 reflects a deliberate emphasis on active engagement with the
 material. The intention is for students to read, to reason, and to
 develop results on their own, as a means of achieving mastery and
 fostering analytic skills.</p>

 <p><alert>Note on reading exercises versus end-of-section
     exercises:</alert> In the narrative for each section, exercises labeled
     "Checkpoint" are meant to be reading exercises, that
     is, part of the process of active reading. Working through
     end-of-section exercises is meant to take place after reading and
     working the reading exercises. The recommended
     order for class discussion is: (1) questions about the reading; (2)
     solutions to reading exercises; and (3) solutions to end-of-section
     exercises.</p>
 
 <p>The text assumes prerequisite courses in calculus, linear algebra,
   and experience with proof writing.</p>

 <p>Here are sample schedules for three possible courses in a 15-week
   semester. Variations are supported by "Additional Exercises"
	    sections in Chapters 2 and 3, and a "Further Topics"
  section at the end of the text.</p>

     <p>Instructor's solutions are intended for the instructor
     only. Please do not give copies of instructor's solutions to
     students. Student's learn by constructing their own derivations,
     explanations, and proofs. Student access to complete solutions
     undermines the goals of the course.
