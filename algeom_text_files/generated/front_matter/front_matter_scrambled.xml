 <p>The text assumes prerequisite courses in calculus, linear algebra,
   and experience with proof writing.</p>

 <p>Here are sample schedules for three possible courses in a 15-week
   semester. Variations are supported by "Additional Exercises"
	    sections in Chapters 2 and 3, and a "Further Topics"
  section at the end of the text.</p>

   <commentary component="instructor"><title><em>Instructor's Solutions</em>
       edition</title>
     <p>Instructor's solutions are intended for the instructor
     only. Please do not give copies of instructor's solutions to
     students. Student's learn by constructing their own derivations,
     explanations, and proofs. Student access to complete solutions
     undermines the goals of the course.
