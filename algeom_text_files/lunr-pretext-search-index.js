  "body": " Preface  The purpose of this text is to take advantage of the overlap between introductory courses in group theory and modern geometry. Group theory typically features geometric content in the form of symmetry groups, and Kleinian geometry relies on the group structure of congruence transformations. Learning the two subjects together enhances both.   This text is two textbooks in one: an introduction to group theory, and an introduction to modern geometries using the Kleinian paradigm. The book can be used for a combined one-semester course in both subjects, or, through supplementary projects, it can be used for a one-semester introduction to group theory or a one-semester introduction to modern geometries.  The chapter on groups develops the basic vocabulary and theory of groups and homomorphisms, culminating with group actions. The chapter on geometry makes use of group symmetries to build the basic theory of MÃ¶bius, hyperbolic, elliptic, and projective geometries. Throughout, a design theme is the use of a small but carefully chosen collection of tools, beginning with the algebra and geometry of complex numbers and quaternions, and using a minimum of machinery from analysis and linear algebra, to develop useful and nontrivial results for group theory and geometry in a way that prefers using conceptual tools to brute computation.  Many results (for example, Lagrange's Theorem for groups and area formulas in hyperbolic and elliptic geometries) are developed in carefully structured exercises, rather than in the reading. This reflects a deliberate emphasis on active engagement with the material. The intention is for students to read, to reason, and to develop results on their own, as a means of achieving mastery and fostering analytic skills.  Note on reading exercises versus end-of-section exercises: In the narrative for each section, exercises labeled Checkpoint are meant to be reading exercises, that is, part of the process of active reading. Working through end-of-section exercises is meant to take place after reading and working the reading exercises. The recommended order for class discussion is: (1) questions about the reading; (2) solutions to reading exercises; and (3) solutions to end-of-section exercises.  The text assumes prerequisite courses in calculus, linear algebra, and experience with proof writing.  Here are sample schedules for three possible courses in a 15-week semester. Variations are supported by Additional Exercises sections in Chapters 2 and 3, and a Further Topics section at the end of the text.

  "title": "Quaternions",
  "body": " Quaternions   The quaternions, discovered by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843, were invented to capture the algebra of rotations of 3-dimensional real space, extending the way that the complex numbers capture the algebra of rotations of 2-dimensional real space.  Elements in the set of quaternions the quaternions are in one-to-one correspondence with points in 4-dimensional real space . We will write to denote that the quaternion corresponds to the 4-tuple of real numbers.   Cartesian form and pure quaternions  The quaternions are defined as follows. The expression is called the Cartesian form Cartesian form of a quaternion of the quaternion that corresponds to the vector in . A quaternion of the form is called a scalar quaternion scalar quaternion  quaternion or a real quaternion real quaternion quaternion. A quaternion of the form is called a pure quaternion pure quaternion quaternion or an imaginary quaternion imaginary quaternion quaternion. For a quaternion , we call the real quaternion the scalar part quaternion scalar part of a quaternion or real part quaternion real part of a quaternion of , and we call the quaternion the vector part quaternion vector part of a quaternion or the imaginary part quaternion imaginary part of a quaternion of . To reflect the natural correspondence of the pure quaternion with the vector in , we will write the space of pure quaternions  to denote the space of pure quaternions.   Correspondence with complex matrices  Analogous to the way that the complex numbers can be realized as the set of real matrices (see ), the quaternions can be realized by a set of complex matrices, as follows. Let denote the set of complex matrices of the form . Given a quaternion , let be the complex numbers and , and let denote the matrix in given by Conversely, given a matrix , with top left entry and top right entry , let denote the quaternion . It is clear that the mappings and are inverses to one another, and establish a one-to-one correspondence .  is closed under addition and multiplication  Let be elements of . Then the sum and the product are also elements of .    Prove .    Addition and multiplication  By virtue of , we can define addition and multiplication of quaternions as follows. Because matrix algebra has associative and distributive laws, these carry over to quaternions. Note that quaternion multiplication is not commutative! However, for any real quaternion , we have , so commutes with all matrices, and therefore commutes with all quaternions. To summarize, let be quaternions and let be a real quaternion. We have the following.   In practice, it is not necessary to convert quaternions to matrices in order to add and multiply. Quaternion addition and multiplication in Cartesian form is analogous to complex multiplication, using the following basic multiplication rules.   Verify and .   For and , we have Multiplication looks like this. If are pure quaternions, can be written more compactly in terms of the dot and cross products for vectors in .    Verify .    Conjugate, modulus, and polar form  The conjugate conjugate of a quaternion of a quaternion is , and the modulus modulus of a quaternion of is . The unit quaternions quaternion unit quaternions groups, list of the unit quaternions , denoted the unit quaternions , is the set of quaternions with modulus 1. The set of unit quaternions is in one-to-one correspondence with the 3-sphere . This is analogous to the set of norm 1 complex numbers that is in one-to-one correspondence with the 1-sphere . Analogous to complex numbers, a quaternion can be expressed in polar form polar form of a quaternion  where is a pure unit quaternion and is a real number.     Show that the following construction produces a polar form for a nonzero quaternion . Let . If , let , and let .  Fill in the remaining details on polar form for quaternions. What happens if ? What happens if ?  Are uniquely determined by ? If not, describe the possible choices for .     Continuing the analogy with complex numbers, we have the following, for all quaternions . .  Verify the three equations above.  Work in . Start by checking that , where denotes the conjugate transpose of a matrix. Alternatively, write in polar form and use .    Quaternions as rotations of  Let be a unit quaternion and let be a pure quaternion. Let denote the quaternion . It is easy to check that . From this we conclude that is a pure quaternion.  Explain how we conclude that is pure when is a unit quaternion and is a pure quaternion.   It is easy to see that is a linear map from the real vector space of unit quaternions to itself. That means that the following properties hold for all pure quaternions and all real scalars .   Show the details to prove that is linear.   We conclude with the main result of this section that shows how rotations of 3-dimensional real space are encoded in the algebra of quaternions.  Quaternions and rotations of  Let be a unit quaternion in polar form, and let be the linear transformation of the space of pure quaternions given by .

Before we give the complete definition of a group in the next section (see ), this section introduces examples of some important and useful groups.

  "title": "Geometries and models",
  "body": " Geometries and models   An integral part of the modern understanding of geometry is the concept of congruence transformation , or simply symmetry . The symmetries of a geometric space preserve inherent properties of figures, such as distance, angle, and area. In his 1872 work called the Erlanger Programm , The German term Erlanger Programm (or Erlangen program in English) is named after the city Erlangen, where Klein worked at the university. Felix Klein unified the study of a wide variety of geometric spaces by overtly placing the group of congruence transformations as part of the structure of a geometry. The following is a version of Klein's definition of geometry.    A geometry geometry is a pair , where is a set, called the (model) space model space , and is a group, called the group of congruence transformations congruence transformations , that acts on . Subsets of are called figures figure . Figures are called congruent congruent if there is an element in such that . We write  figure is congruent to figure to denote that figures are congruent.   Note on terminology and notation: throughout this chapter on geometry, the term transformation will always mean a one-to-one and onto map of a space to itself. Given a geometry with group action , we will abuse notation and write to denote the map for an element in . It is common usage to say the transformation to mean the transformation of the space .   Show that congruence is an equivalence relation on the set of figures in a geometry.    Examples of geometries    Planar Euclidean geometry Euclidean planar geometry geometries, list of Euclidean planar geometry  . The model space for planar Euclidean geometry is the plane . The group of congruence transformations consists of translations, rotations, reflections, and their compositions. Specifically, Euclidean congruences are functions of the form , where , is an element of the group of orthogonal matrices, and .  Spherical geometry. spherical geometry geometries, list of spherical geometry spherical geometry The model space for spherical geometry is the sphere . The group of congruence transformations consists of rotations of the sphere and reflections across planes through the origin. Specifically, spherical congruences are functions of the form , where , , and is an element of the group of orthogonal matrices.  Projective geometry. projective geometry geometries, list of projective geometry  The model space for a projective geometry is projective space , where is a vector space (see in the previous chapter). The group of congruence transformations is the projective linear group .     Planar geometries  Much of this chapter on geometry is devoted to a family of planar geometries whose model spaces are the extended complex plane (described in section ) and some of its subsets. One of the properties shared by the congruence transformations in all of these planar geometries is conformality , or angle preservation. To say that a transformation is conformal conformal transformation means that if two curves and make an oriented angle at a point of intersection, then the two image curves and also make the same oriented angle at the point of intersection (the angle made by two curves is the angle made by their tangents at the point of intersection). See . examines the conformal properties of the four basic types of complex functions summarized in .  Conformal maps preserve oriented angles    homothety   Basic types of transformations     homothety      rotation      translation      inversion         Remark on convention: If and if we write , this implies that we mean that is real and positive. This remark pertains to the definition of homothety Some texts define homothety to mean that can be any nonzero real scalar. We follow the convention from complex analysis that restricts homotheties to positive real scalars. For example, see . in above, and in the classification of normal forms, summarized in in the next section.   Subgeometries and equivalent geometries   Subgeometry We say that a geometry is a subgeometry subgeometry  of a geometry if is a subset of and is a subgroup of and the action of on is compatible with the action of on in the sense that has the same value in both geometries and for all .      Equivalent geometries  Geometries and are equivalent equivalent geometries  if there is a bijective map such that every element of has a conjugate transformation in and every element of has a conjugate transformation in . In symbols: See the note on terminology at the beginning of this section: the equation below really means , where are the actions of on and on , respectively.   for every , there is an such that , and  for every , there is a such that .  Equivalent geometries are said to be models of the same geometry.      Note on terminology: the term geometry is used to refer to a specific model as in definition , and also to refer to an equivalence class of geometries. This is similar to the situation for groups, where the term the cyclic group of order can refer to additive group , or the multiplicative group of th complex roots of unity, or simply the isomorphism class of these groups.

This means that for any triple of distinct input values in and any triple of distinct output values in , there is a unique such that for .      Cross ratio  Given three distinct points in , we write to denote the unique MÃ¶bius transformation that satisfies , , and (the existence and uniqueness of this transformation is guaranteed by the Fundamental Theorem of MÃ¶bius Geometry). We write to denote the image of under . The expression is called the cross ratio cross ratio of MÃ¶bius geometry of the 4-tuple . By , we have the following explicit formula for the cross ratio.  The cross ratio is a useful tool because it is invariant under MÃ¶bius transformations. Here is the formal statement with a proof.  Cross ratio is invariant Let be distinct points in , let , and let be any MÃ¶bius transformation. Then we have    The transformations and both send , , and , so they must be equal, by the Fundamental Theorem. Now apply both transformations to .      Clines (generalized circles)  A Euclidean circle or straight line is called a cline cline (pronounced kline ) or generalized circle generalized circle . The propositions and corollaries in this subsection show that the set of all clines is a single congruence class of figures in MÃ¶bius geometry.  Let be distinct points in , let , and let be the inverse image of the extended real line under . Then is a Euclidean circle or straight line. Furthermore, is the unique Euclidean circle or straight line that contains the points .    The cross ratio is real if and only if lie on a Euclidean circle or straight line.    Explain how follows from .    Let be a Euclidean circle or straight line in and let be any MÃ¶bius transformation. Then is a Euclidean circle or straight line.    Explain how follows from .  Let be three points on and let . Let and let . Explain why and hence that must be a cline.    All clines are congruent in MÃ¶bius geometry.    Explain how follows from .  Start here: Let be two clines. Let be three points on and let be three points on . Let and let , and let . Explain why takes to .     Symmetry with respect to a cline  Geometrically, the conjugation map in the complex plane is reflection across the real line. This mirror symmetry generalizes to symmetry with respect to any cline, as follows. Given a cline that contains in , let . Given any point , the symmetric point with respect to  is where is the extension of the conjugation map to the extended complex plane that sends . The idea is to map to the real line via , then conjugate, then map the real line back to . See .   Symmetric points with respect to the circle     Show that the symmetric point of a symmetric point is the point you started with. That is, show that . This allows us to speak of a pair of symmetric points without ambiguity.    The definition of depends only on the cline , and not on the three points .    Let be a cline and let be a MÃ¶bius transformation. If are a pair of points that are symmetric with respect to , then are symmetric with respect to the cline . That is, we have   Let be three points on , so that are three points on . Let and let . By invariance of the cross ratio, we have . Thus we have as desired.     Normal forms  We conclude this section on MÃ¶bius geometry with a discussion of the normal form normal form of a MÃ¶bius transformation. We begin with a Lemma.  If a MÃ¶bius transformation has exactly two fixed points and , then it has the form for some nonzero . If a MÃ¶bius transformation has a single fixed point at , then it has the form for some nonzero .    Now suppose that a MÃ¶bius transformation has two fixed points, and . Let be given by .

The transformation is called elliptic elliptic MÃ¶bius transformation , hyperbolic hyperbolic MÃ¶bius transformation , or loxodromic loxodromic MÃ¶bius transformation if is a rotation ( ), a homothety ( ), or neither, respectively.  Finally, suppose that a MÃ¶bius transformation has exactly one fixed point at . Let be given by . Again, let and let . This time, has exactly one fixed point at . Applying the Lemma, we have for some nonzero . Applying both sides of to , we have the following normal form for .

The convention for which Steiner circles are considered first or second kinds is not universal. Here we follow the convention used by Ahlfors and Henle . In the case where has two fixed points , the conjugating map takes , . Therefore maps and .

  "body": " Hyperbolic geometry   Before the discovery of hyperbolic geometry, it was believed that Euclidean geometry was the only possible geometry of the plane. In fact, hyperbolic geometry arose as a byproduct of efforts to prove that there was no alternative to Euclidean geometry. In this section, we present a Kleinian version of hyperbolic geometry.  Let  the open unit disk  denote the open unit disk in the complex plane. The hyperbolic group hyperbolic group , denoted  the hyperbolic group  , is the subgroup of the MÃ¶bius group of transformations that map onto itself. The pair is the (PoincarÃ©) disk model PoincarÃ© disk model of hyperbolic geometry  geometries, list of hyperbolic geometry  disk model   hyperbolic geometry disk model  of hyperbolic geometry.    Comments on terminology: Beware of the two different meanings of the adjective hyperbolic . To say that a MÃ¶bius transformation is hyperbolic means that it is conjugate to a homothety (see ). That is not the same thing as an element of the group of hyperbolic transformations.   The hyperbolic transformation group  Our first task is to characterize transformations in the group . We begin with an observation about MÃ¶bius transformations that map one side of a cline to itself. This is pertinent because the disk is the inside of the cline which is the unit circle. It will be useful to start with a general case.  Any cline divides the extended plane into two regions. If is a Euclidean circle, we might called these regions the inside and the outside of . If is a Euclidean straight line, we simply have one side and the other of .   MÃ¶bius transformations that map one side of a cline to itself  Let be a cline, and let be the two disjoint regions of . Let be a MÃ¶bius transformation that maps onto itself. Then also maps onto itself, and maps onto itself.  Sketch: Suppose that maps onto itself. The other side of is the set of points that are symmetric, with respect to , to the points in . By , maps symmetric points to symmetric points, so maps into itself. It is easy to check that, in fact, maps  onto itself. By elimination, it must be that maps onto itself.    Complete the sketch of the proof of .   If , then maps the unit circle onto itself.     Given , let be the point that maps to . It must be that maps the symmetric point to . Let be the point that maps to . Then has the form (see ) Multiplying top and bottom by , and setting , we have A straightforward derivation shows that , so that we have below. Another computation establishes an alternative formula for . See .  A MÃ¶bius transformation is in if an only if can be written in the form for some and . Alternatively, we have if and only if can be written in the form for some such that .     Classification of clines in hyperbolic geometry  The clines of MÃ¶bius geometry are classified into several types in hyperbolic geometry, as summarized in .  Clines in hyperbolic geometry    hyperbolic curve type   cline type    hyperbolic straight line   a cline that intersects the unit circle at right angles     hyperbolic circle   a circle completely contained in    horocycle   a circle with all but one point in , tangent to the unit circle    hypercycle   a cline that intersects the unit circle at a non-right angle      Show that each of the four categories of clines in is preserved by transformations in the hyperbolic group. That is, show that any transformation in the hyperbolic group takes hyperbolic straight lines to hyperbolic straight lines, takes hyperbolic circles to hyperbolic circles, takes horocycles to horocycles, and takes hypercycles to hypercycles.    Show that a hyperbolic straight line that contains 0 must be a diameter of the unit circle.  Prove the contrapositive: assume is a hyperbolic straight line that is also a Euclidean circle, and intersects the unit circle orthogonally at . Give an argument why can not contain 0.    Show that all hyperbolic straight lines are congruent.  Start by showing that any hyperbolic straight line is congruent to .     Normal forms for the hyperbolic group  In this subsection, we follow the development of normal forms for general MÃ¶bius transformations given in to derive normal forms and graphical interpretations for transformations in the hyperbolic group. We begin with an observation about fixed points of a MÃ¶bius transformation that maps a cline to itself.  Let and let be a cline. If , then .   Apply .    Now let be a non-identity element of . The fact that maps the unit circle to itself implies that there are exactly three possible cases for fixed points of . There is a pair of fixed points with , , and , that is, are a pair of symmetric points (with respect to the unit circle) that do not lie on the unit circle.  There is a pair of fixed points that lie on the unit circle.  There is a single fixed point that lies on the unit circle.    Give an argument to justify the three cases above.     Three types of hyperbolic transformations    For cases 1 and 2 above, the map acting on the -plane is conjugate to the map acting on the -plane by , for some nonzero , via the map . In case 1, the map takes the unit circle to some polar circle, say , so must map to itself. It follows that , so the MÃ¶bius normal form type for is elliptic. The action of is a rotation about Steiner circles of the second kind (hyperbolic circles) with respect to the fixed points . A transformation of this type is called a hyperbolic rotation hyperbolic rotation . See .  For case 2, the map takes the unit circle to a straight line, say , through the origin, so must map to itself. It follows that is real. Since maps to one of the two half planes on either side of , the map must take this half plane to itself. If follows that must be a positive real number, so the MÃ¶bius normal form type for is hyperbolic. The action of is a flow about Steiner circles of the first kind (hypercycles and one hyperbolic straight line) with respect to the fixed points . A transformation of this type is called a hyperbolic translation hyperbolic translation . See .  For case 3, the conjugating map takes to of the form for some . The MÃ¶bius normal form type for is parabolic. The action of is a flow along degenerate Steiner circles (horocycles) tangent to the unit circle at . A transformation of this type is called a parallel displacement parallel displacement . See .  This completes the list of transformation types for the hyperbolic group. See for a summary.

  "body": " Elliptic geometry   Elliptic geometry is the geometry of the sphere (the 2-dimensional surface of a 3-dimensional solid ball), where congruence transformations are the rotations of the sphere about its center.  We will work with three models for elliptic geometry: one based on quaternions, one based on rotations of the sphere, and another that is a subgeometry of MÃ¶bius geometry. Using the natural identification of the pure quaternions with , we will write to denote the set of unit pure quaternions, that is, We begin by establishing some basic facts about the relevant transformation groups.   The group of unit quaternions  Recall from that is the set of quaternions of modulus 1. In fact, is a group.  Show that is a group.    Recall that the map sends to the matrix . The image of under is the matrix group special unitary group groups, list of special unitary group   the special unitary group  called the special unitary group. Restricting the domain of to and restricting the codomain of to is an isomorphism of groups   Show that is a group. Show that is a homomorphism.  It is not necessary to perform any new computation to show that is a homomorphism. Instead, use .    The action of a unit quaternion as a rotation on (see ) takes the sphere to itself. The action of the group on defines a model of elliptic geometry.  The quaternion model  elliptic geometry quaternion model  geometries, list of  elliptic geometry quaternion model of elliptic geometry is .  Show that the map given by is a group action.     The group of rotations of the 2-sphere  Let  rotation about the axis by angle   denote the rotation of about the axis given by a unit vector by an angle . We use the standard orientation, so that a positive value of is a counterclockwise rotation of the plane orthogonal to , as viewed from above where points in the up direction. See .    The rotation about the vector by the angle     Notation convention: For readability and convenience, we write to denote rotations by radians about the standard basis vectors , respectively.  We will write to denote the set of all rotations. To see why the set is a group For the purpose of a self-contained exposition based on elementary geometry, using only complex and quaternion algebra, we do not utilize the fact that is the group of orthogonal transformations of with determinant 1. under the operation of composition, consider the map given by established by . The fact that (see ) implies that the composition of two rotations is a rotation. The remaining group properties are straightforward. Once we have proved that is a group, the same equation shows that the map is a homomorphism of groups . The kernel of this homomorphism is . This establishes an isomorphism   Complete the details to show that is a group. Show that the kernel of the homomorphism given by is .  Use .    The spherical model  elliptic geometry spherical model  geometries, list of  elliptic geometry spherical model of elliptic geometry is .  We conclude with a useful fact about constructing arbitrary rotations by composing rotations from a specific set elementary types, namely, rotations about the -axis by arbitrary angles, and rotations about the -axis by radians. We start with a Lemma that shows how to do this for -axis rotations.  Rotations about the -axis An arbitrary rotation about the -axis is a composition of a rotations about the -axis by radians with a rotation about the -axis. Specifically, we have the following.   Visualize! You can also verify by checking that both sides of yield the same result when evaluated on the three standard basis vectors. Yet another proof is to do a quaternion computation.    Generators for   The set is a generating set for . This means that any rotation may be written as a composition of rotations about the -axis and rotations about the -axis by radians.   Consider a model of the sphere printed with a map of the world (i.e., a geographic globe) in such a way that the north pole is on top of the sphere and Greenwich, England (at zero degrees longitude) is in the -plane. The sphere in the upper left of depicts this start position of the north pole , Greenwich , and the great circle that is the intersection of the sphere with the -plane ( is shown in red in all four spheres for reference). Now let be an arbitrary rotation. The sphere in the upper right of shows how  , , and are transformed by . The rest of the diagram shows how we can write as a composition of rotations by putting the north pole back on top and putting zero degrees back in place , as follows. From the upper right in the diagram, we put the north pole back by first performing a rotation about the -axis that brings the north pole into the -plane. Next, we perform the rotation about the -axis (use the Lemma) to bring the north pole back to the top. Finally, we perform a rotation to bring Greenwich back home in the -plane. Reading clockwise from the upper left of the diagram, the sequence of transformations takes the north pole through the sequence . Meanwhile, traces the path while the great circle is transformed in the sequence This leads to the decomposition .   Decomposition of the rotation        The elliptic subgroup of the MÃ¶bius group    Let  the elliptic group  denote the group of transformations of that are conjugate to rotations of via the stereographic projection . The group is called the elliptic group elliptic group  groups, list of elliptic group  . It is easy to check that the map given by is an isomorphism of groups, so we have   Show that is indeed a group. Show that is a group isomorphism .    Exercises in show that the MÃ¶bius transformation given by (see ) and that is the MÃ¶bius transformation given by (see ). The fact ( ) that rotations of the form generate implies that the MÃ¶bius transformations and generate . Therefore is in fact a subgroup of the MÃ¶bius group.  The MÃ¶bius subgeometry model  elliptic geometry MÃ¶bius subgeometry model   geometries, list of elliptic geometry MÃ¶bius subgeometry model  of elliptic geometry is .  We can say more about the specific form of elements in in terms of the group homomorphism that sends the matrix to the MÃ¶bius transformation (see ). Observe that the transformations are images of elements of the group (see ). Because generate , it follows that every element of is the image under of an element of .  Let denote the matrices , respectively. Verify that are indeed elements of . Verify and . Explain the final comment in the paragraph above. Why does it follow that every element of is the image of an element of ?    Thus we have proved the following explicit formula for elements of .  Formula for transformations in the elliptic group  A map is an element of if and only if may be written in the form for some with .    Setting and , we have the following alternative form for .    Circles in and clines in   A circle in is a circle in a plane intersecting . A great circle great circle is the intersection of with a plane through the origin. In elliptic geometry, a great circle is called an elliptic straight line because the path of shortest length connecting two given points in is an arc of a great circle. Circles in that are not great circles are called elliptic cycles . Elliptic straight lines and elliptic cycles in the MÃ¶bius subgeometry model are stereographic projections of elliptic straight lines and elliptic cycles in the spherical model. It turns out that elliptic straight lines and elliptic cycles in are in fact clines. Here is the statement and proof.  Stereographic projection takes circles to clines   Let be a circle that is the intersection of with a plane in . If contains the north pole of , then is a Euclidean straight line in . Otherwise, is a circle in .   Proof sketch: The statement about the case when contains the north pole is geometrically clear. For the case when does not contain , choose a rotation of that takes some point on to the north pole. Again, let be the conjugate element in . It is clear that takes to a circle, that takes to a Euclidean straight line, and that takes to a cline (because is a MÃ¶bius transformation!). Thus is a cline. Because is not on , it must be that is not on , so is a circle in .     Angles and orientation on   The standard orientation for angles on (see ) is also called the outward-pointing normal orientation. The standard orientation measures angles from the viewpoint of an observer standing on the outside of the sphere. The inward-pointing normal orientation is the reverse orientation that measures angles from the viewpoint of an observer walking on the inside of the sphere. See .   Two orientations on the sphere: oriented angle is positive viewed from the outward-pointing normal vector , but is negative viewed from the inward-pointing vector .    Stereographic projection is conformal  Stereographic projection preserves oriented angles with respect to the inward-pointing normal orientation.   Proof sketch: Begin with the special case of curves that intersect at the south pole . The lines that are tangent to at lie in planes that contain the south pole and the origin. The tangents also lie in the plane tangent to the sphere at the south pole. It is clear that the lines tangent to at are straight lines that intersect at the origin. The angle made by is the same as the angle made by the planes , but with inward-normal orientation! See . Now suppose two curves intersect at . Choose a rotation of that takes to the south pole, and let be the conjugate element in . It is clear that and are conformal (because is a MÃ¶bius transformation!). Now the fact that is conformal at implies that is conformal at .   Stereographic projection is conformal at .       Elliptic length and area  The distance between points on is the length of the arc of a great circle that connects them. Because the sphere has radius 1, the arc length is the same as the radian measure of the angle , where is the origin. From vector calculus, we have the following dot product formula. Solving for , we obtain the formula for the distance between points in .   To transfer the metric to by stereographic projection means that we define the elliptic metric on by the following.   The elliptic metric is invariant under the action of the elliptic group. That is, we have for all and for all .    In order to obtain a formula for computing , we follow the same procedure for hyperbolic distance. First, we find the distance , where . Let and let . Let , let , let and let (see ). It is a simple exercise to show that , so that we have    Transferring the natural metric on to via stereographic projection.    Show that in .    For the general case, let . Because and let be the transformation in (using the form ) that sends and . Applying , we have the elliptic distance formula in . Now let be a parametric curve in .

Show that the first order Taylor approximation for is . Complete the details of modifying the derivation of the hyperbolic length integral formula to obtain the elliptic length integral formula.    Find the length of the elliptic cycle parameterized by for , where .   Using the same argument as in the paragraph preceding the hyperbolic area integral formula , using the elliptic length differential in place of the hyperbolic length differential and making the appropriate changes, we obtain the elliptic area integral formula.   Find the area of the elliptic disk , for .     Show that the three models of elliptic geometry are equivalent.    Prove .

In this section, we present a modern Kleinian version of projective geometry.  Throughout this section, is a field, is a vector space over , is the projective space, and is the projective transformation group. See for definitions and details. We will write for the projective transformation that is the equivalence class of the linear transformation of .   Projective points, lines, and flats  Points in projective space correspond bijectively to 1-dimensional subspaces of via The set of 1-dimensional subspaces in , denoted , is an alternative model space for projective geometry. We will usually denote points in projective space using capital letters, such as , , etc.  A line projective geometry line in projective space  in projective space is a set of the form for some 2-dimensional subspace in . Thus, projective lines correspond bijectively to 2-dimensional subspaces of via The set of 2-dimensional subspaces in is denoted . Points in projective space are called collinear projective geometry collinear projective points  if they lie together on a projective line. We will usually denote projective lines using lower case letters, such as , , etc.  There is an offset by 1 in the use of the word dimension in regards to subsets of and the corresponding subspace in . In general, a -dimensional flat projective geometry -dimensional flat in is a set of the form , where denotes the set of -dimensional subspaces of . The set is called the Grassmannian of -dimensional subspaces of , named in honor of Hermann Grassmann. Flats are also called subspaces in projective space, even though projective space is not a vector space.  Points are said to be in general position if the vectors are independent in .   Coordinates  For the remainder of this section, we consider . For readability, we will write (rather than the more cumbersome ) to denote the point in projective space that is the projective equivalence class of the point in . The entries are called homogeneous coordinates projective geometry homogeneous coordinates  of . If , then The numbers for are called inhomogeneous coordinates projective geometry inhomogeneous coordinates  for . The degrees of freedom that are apparent in inhomogeneous coordinates explain why is called -dimensional. Many texts write , , or simply when is understood, to denote .   Freedom in projective transformations  In an -dimensional vector space, any independent vectors can be mapped to any other set of independent vectors by a linear transformation. Therefore it seems a little surprising that in -dimensional projective space , it is possible to map any set of points to any other set of points, provided both sets of points meet sufficient independence conditions. This subsection gives the details of this result, called the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry.  Let denote the standard basis vectors for and let . Let be another basis for and let be nonzero scalars. Let be the linear transformation of given by for . Projectively, sends and .  Now suppose there is another map that agrees with on the points . Then fixes all the points . This means that for some nonzero scalars and that for some . This implies so we have . Therefore is the identity transformation, so . We have just proved the following existence and uniqueness lemma.  Let be an independent set of vectors in and let for some nonzero scalars . There exists a unique projective transformation that maps for .    Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry  Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry   Let be a set of points in such that all subsets of size are in general position. Let be another such set. There exists a unique projective transformation that maps , .     The real projective plane  The remainder of this section is devoted to the planar geometry called the real projective plane projective geometry real projective plane . It is of historical interest because of its early practical use by artists. Lines through the origin in model sight lines in the real world as seen from an eye placed at the origin. A plane that does not pass through the origin models the picture plane of the artist's canvas. shows a woodcut by Albrecht DÃ¼rer that illustrates a perspective machine gadget used by 16th century artists to put the projective model into practice for image making.   Man drawing a lute , Albrecht DÃ¼rer, 1525.    A two dimensional subspace in is specified by a normal vector via the equation , that is, a point lies on with normal vector if and only if . Any nonzero multiple of is also a normal vector for , so the set of 2-dimensional subspaces in is in one-to-one correspondence with . We will write to denote the projective line whose corresponding 2-dimensional subspace in has normal vectors proportional to . Beware the overloaded notation! Whether the equivalence class of a vector in denotes a projective point or a projective line has to be specified.  The equation makes sense projectively . This means that if for vectors , then , even though the value of the dot product is not well-defined for projective equivalence classes! Thus we will write for a projective line and a projective point , to mean , and we make the following interpretation of the dot product as an incidence relation in . Given two independent vectors in , their cross product is a normal vector for the 2-dimensional space spanned by . Given two 2-dimensional subspaces in with normal vectors , the cross product is a vector that lies along the 1-dimensional subspace . The bilinearity of cross product implies that cross product is well-defined on projective classes, i.e., we can write . Thus we have the following.  Given two points in , there is a unique projective line that contains them. Given two lines in , there is a unique projective point in their intersection .
