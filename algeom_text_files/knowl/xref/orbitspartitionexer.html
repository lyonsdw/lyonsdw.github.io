<div class="para">Prove <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/orbitspartition.html" title="Proposition 2.5.4: Orbits of a group action form a partition">PropositionÂ 2.5.4</a>. This Proposition is written in a style called "Proposition/Definition(s)". This means that part of the statement consists of one or more claims that require proof, and part of the statement consists of one or more definitions which do not require proof, but rely on the claim(s) of the proposition in order to make sense. The main claim is that the orbits of a group action partition the set on which the group acts. Here is how to organize your proof. First, show that the relation relation <span class="process-math">\(\sim_G\)</span> is indeed an equivalence relation. Second, show that <span class="process-math">\(y\sim_G x\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(y\in \Orb(x)\text{.}\)</span> Now the main claim follows as a consequence. Your proof does not have to bother with the notation <span class="process-math">\(X/G\text{.}\)</span> It is a <em class="emphasis">definition</em> that <span class="process-math">\(X/G=X/\!\!\sim_G\text{,}\)</span> so that equality does not require proof.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="groups_chapter-6.html#orbitspartitionexer">in-context</a></span>
