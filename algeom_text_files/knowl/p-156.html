<p>A (straight) "line segment" can be defined, both for the plane and the sphere, as a path of shortest possible length that connects two points. On the sphere, these length minmimizing paths are arcs of great circles (that is, circles made by intersecting the sphere with planes that pass through the center of the sphere). In addition to distance and straight lines, angles between straight line segments make sense both in the plane and on the sphere. Here a some notable differences between the plane and the sphere that illustrate the phrase "properties of configurations of points".</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>A (straight) "railroad track" is a pair of straight line segments that are a constant distance apart. It is possible to map out railroad tracks in the plane, but not on the sphere, where it is impossible to have a pair of straight line segments that are a constant distance apart.</li>
<li>In the plane, the sum of the three interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees, or \(\pi\) radians. On the sphere, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">greater</em> than 180 degrees, and can be as great as 540 degrees.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">These differences in properties of parallel lines and angle sums in triangles are expressions of the differences in shape possessed by the flat plane and the sphere. In order to define "shape" and "geometry" more precisely, we blah blah blah In order to proceed from these observations do not point to an obvious definition of shape.</p>
