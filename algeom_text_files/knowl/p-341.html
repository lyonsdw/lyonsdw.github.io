<div class="para">An integral part of the modern understanding of geometry is the concept of <em class="emphasis">congruence transformation</em>, or simply <em class="emphasis">symmetry</em>. The symmetries of a geometric space preserve inherent properties of figures, such as distance, angle, and area. In his 1872 work called the <i class="foreign">Erlanger Programm</i><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-11-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, Felix Klein unified the study of a wide variety of geometric spaces by overtly placing the group of congruence transformations as part of the structure of a geometry. The following is a version of Klein's definition of geometry.  <article class="definition definition-like"><h3 class="heading">

</h3>A <dfn class="terminology">geometry</dfn> is a pair <span class="process-math">\((X,G)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a set, called the <dfn class="terminology">(model) space</dfn>, and <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is a group, called the group of <dfn class="terminology">congruence transformations</dfn>, that acts on <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Subsets of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> are called <dfn class="terminology">figures</dfn>. Figures <span class="process-math">\(F,F'\)</span> are called <dfn class="terminology">congruent</dfn> if there is an element <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(g(F)=F'\text{.}\)</span> We write <span class="process-math">\(F\cong F'\)</span> to denote that figures <span class="process-math">\(F,F'\)</span> are congruent.</article> <em class="alert">Note on terminology and notation:</em> throughout this chapter on geometry, the term <em class="emphasis">transformation</em> will always mean a one-to-one and onto map of a space to itself. Given a geometry <span class="process-math">\((X,G)\)</span> with group action <span class="process-math">\(\phi\colon G\to \Perm(X)\text{,}\)</span> we will abuse notation and write <span class="process-math">\(g\colon X\to X\)</span> to denote the map <span class="process-math">\(\phi(g)\colon X\to
X\)</span> for an element <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> It is common usage to say "the transformation <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span>" to mean "the transformation <span class="process-math">\(\phi(g)\)</span>" of the space <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>
