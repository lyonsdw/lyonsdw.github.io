<div class="para">The remainder of this section is devoted to the planar geometry <span class="process-math">\(\Proj(\R^3)=\R\Proj_2\)</span> called the <dfn class="terminology">real projective plane</dfn>. It is of historical interest because of its early practical use by artists. Lines through the origin in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> model sight lines in the real world as seen from an eye placed at the origin. A plane that does not pass through the origin models the "picture plane" of the artist’s canvas. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/durerpicture.html" title="Figure 3.5.3">Figure 3.5.3</a> shows a woodcut by Albrecht Dürer that illustrates a "perspective machine" gadget used by 16th century artists to put the projective model into practice for image making.</div>
