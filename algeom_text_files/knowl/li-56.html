</h4>(A simple sketch might be a color-coded doubly-infinite sequence <span class="process-math">\(\ldots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots\)</span> with colors spaced <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> units apart. Another possible sketch is an array with <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> rows indexed <span class="process-math">\(0..n-1\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th row <span class="process-math">\(\ldots
-3n+k,-2n+k,-n+k,k,n+k,2n+k,3n+k\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Yet another sketch is the unit circle with dots at the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th roots of unity, with the <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>th row in the previously described sketch attached to <span class="process-math">\(e^{2\pi i k/n}\text{.}\)</span> This last sketch is intructional, and connects ideas from algebra and geometry. The instructor might perform this sketch, starting with the unit circle, then winding counterclockwise adding labels <span class="process-math">\(0,1,2,\ldots,n,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Go around three times, inserting commas, and finally ellipses, reinforcing how the sequences grow. Then go around counter clockwise with the sequence <span class="process-math">\(-1,-2,-3,\ldots\text{,}\)</span> winding a couple of times.)</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-4.html#li-56" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
