<p>The two surveyors come back with the following reports. (put in a figure here)</p>
<ul class="disc">

<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Ant \(A\text{,}\) from table world</em>: I was able to map many possible railroad tracks. I checked many triangles, and I find that the three interior angles of all of those triangles sum to a total of one-half revolution.<a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-8-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>

<em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Ant \(B\text{,}\) from sphere world</em>: I was not able to map out a single railroad track: for every pair of straight paths I checked, those paths either became further apart or closer together. I found a triangle whose three interior angles sum to a total of one and one-half revolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">From their experiences with small flat surfaces (like flat rocks) and small round surfaces (like round fruit), the ants were able to hypothesize that the differences in their empirical evidence was due to differing <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">shape</em> of the worlds they were measuring.</p>
