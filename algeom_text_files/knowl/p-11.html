<em class="alert">Note on reading exercises versus end-of-section exercises:</em> In the narrative for each section, exercises labeled "Checkpoint" are meant to be reading exercises, that is, part of the process of active reading. Working through end-of-section exercises is meant to take place after reading and working the reading exercises. The recommended order for class discussion is: (1) questions about the reading; (2) solutions to reading exercises; and (3) solutions to end-of-section exercises.</div>
