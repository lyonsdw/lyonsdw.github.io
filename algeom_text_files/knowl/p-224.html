<li>Let \(H\) be a nontrivial subgroup of \(\Z\text{,}\) and let \(d\) be the smallest positive element of \(H\) (because of closure under inverses, such a \(d\) is guaranteed to exist). It is clear that \(H\) contains all integer multiples of \(d\text{.}\) Given any element \(a\in H\text{,}\) use the division algorithm to write \(a=dq+r\text{,}\) with \(0\leq r\leq d-1\text{.}\) We see that \(r=a-dq\) is in \(H\text{,}\) so it must be that \(r=0\text{.}\)</li>
<li>(The same proof in part 1 for \(\Z\) also works for \(\Z_n\text{.}\))</li>
<li>Let \(d\) be the smallest positive element in \(H=\langle n_1,\ldots,n_r\rangle\text{.}\) By the previous part, \(H=\langle d\rangle\text{,}\) so each \(n_i\) is a multiple of \(d\text{,}\) i.e., \(d\) is a common divisor of the \(n_i\text{.}\) Because every element of \(H\) is a \(\Z\)-linear combination of the \(n_i\text{,}\) there must exist integers \(c_i\) such that \(d=\sum_ic_in_i\text{.}\) If \(d'\) is also a common divisor of the \(n_i\text{,}\) then there exist integers \(k_i\) such that \(n_i=k_id'\text{.}\) Then we have \(d=\sum_i
c_i(k_id')=d'\sum_ic_ik_i\text{.}\) Because \(d,d'\) are both positive integers, it must be that \(\sum_ic_ik_i\) is a positive integer, so we conclude that \(d'\leq
d\text{.}\) Thus we have proved that \(d=\gcd(n_1,\ldots,n_r)\text{.}\)</li>
