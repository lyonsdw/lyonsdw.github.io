<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> be a nontrivial subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> be the smallest positive element of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> (because of closure under inverses, such a <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is guaranteed to exist). It is clear that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> contains all integer multiples of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> Given any element <span class="process-math">\(a\in H\text{,}\)</span> use the division algorithm to write <span class="process-math">\(a=dq+r\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(0\leq r\leq d-1\text{.}\)</span> We see that <span class="process-math">\(r=a-dq\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{,}\)</span> so it must be that <span class="process-math">\(r=0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>(The same proof in part 1 for <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> also works for <span class="process-math">\(\Z_n\text{.}\)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> be the smallest positive element in <span class="process-math">\(H=\langle n_1,\ldots,n_r\rangle\text{.}\)</span> By the previous part, <span class="process-math">\(H=\langle d\rangle\text{,}\)</span> so each <span class="process-math">\(n_i\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> i.e., <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is a common divisor of the <span class="process-math">\(n_i\text{.}\)</span> Because every element of <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span>-linear combination of the <span class="process-math">\(n_i\text{,}\)</span> there must exist integers <span class="process-math">\(c_i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(d=\sum_ic_in_i\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(d'\)</span> is also a common divisor of the <span class="process-math">\(n_i\text{,}\)</span> then there exist integers <span class="process-math">\(k_i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(n_i=k_id'\text{.}\)</span> Then we have <span class="process-math">\(d=\sum_i
c_i(k_id')=d'\sum_ic_ik_i\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(d,d'\)</span> are both positive integers, it must be that <span class="process-math">\(\sum_ic_ik_i\)</span> is a positive integer, so we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(d'\leq
d\text{.}\)</span> Thus we have proved that <span class="process-math">\(d=\gcd(n_1,\ldots,n_r)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
