      <p>
Sketch the examples of euclidean and spherical geometries, how points,
lines, triangles, distance, and area make sense in both, but how facts
differ: parallel lines, sum of angles in a triangle, area! How groups
come in to the picture.

      Two geometries are equivalent if there are the right kind of
      equivariant maps between them. Example: 
      Möbius geometry as projective geometry of the projective space
      of <m>\C^2</m>, introduce stereographic projection as a tool.
