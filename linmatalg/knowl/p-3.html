<div class="para">A secondary purpose of these notes is to address the common practice in undergraduate textbooks (even in courses on linear algebra!) of introducing matrix multiplication as a "voodoo" practice, that is, a complicated operation on boxes of numbers given without motivation. Here, we develop matrix multiplication as the natural consequence of the fact that matrices represent linear transformations: the product of matrices that represent two linear transformations is the matrix that represents their composition. For this development alone, the first three sections of these notes could be of use in a linear algebra course.</div>
