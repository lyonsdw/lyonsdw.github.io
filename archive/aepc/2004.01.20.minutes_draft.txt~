AEPC MINUTES


The Academic Evaluation and Policies Committee convened Tuesday, January
20, 2004 at 11:00 a.m. in Humanities 103.  Present:  David Lyons
(chair), Paul Heise, Donald Kline, Louis Laguna, Jeff Robbins, Barbara
Anderman (secretary), Karen Best.  Stephen MacDonald attended the first
thirty minutes of the meeting. Absent: Melissa Knoll (student
representative).  

1.  The minutes from the November 18 meeting were approved and will be
distributed to the faculty.

2.  The dates of meetings for the spring 2004 semester were established.

3.  David Lyons told the committee that the Study Abroad evaluation
should be completed in about one week.  He did not yet know when the
Chemistry department evaluation would be available.

4.  A master schedule of past evaluations will be circulated to the
entire faculty (rather than to department chairs, as previously
reported), so that any inaccuracies can be corrected.

5.  Karen Best agreed to bring to the committee information about the
number of hours required for student internships.  

6.  The committee will review a proposal to establish a minimum GPA for
graduation with a minor.  The GPA will be the same as that for

7.  The committee completed its discussion of the Writing Center
evaluation submitted by Walter Labonte.  

The meeting adjourned at 11:47 a.m.  The next meeting of the AEPC is
scheduled for Tuesday, February 3, 2004 at 11:00 a.m. in Humanities 103.


Respectfully submitted,
