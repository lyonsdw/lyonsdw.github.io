<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">box model</dfn> consists of a box that contains tickets, each of which is equally likely to be selected on any single random draw from the box, as in a fair lottery or raffle. In this course, every chance process can be modeled in terms of a sequence of one or more random draws from a box of tickets. The sequence of draws can be conducted in two different ways: <dfn class="terminology">with replacement</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">without replacement</dfn>. These terms refer to whether or not each ticket drawn from the box is replaced in the box before the next draw; either way, it is assumed that on any given draw, every ticket in the box at that moment has an equal chance to be selected.</div>
