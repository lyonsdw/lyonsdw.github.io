<div class="para">Sampling theory derives its power from a fact called the <dfn class="terminology">Central Limit Theorem</dfn>. The Central Limit Theorem says that, no matter what numbers are in a box model, the histogram of all possible (standardized) sample sums (which is the same as the standardized sample average or the standardized sample percentage of 1â€™s) is close to the standard normal distribution, as long as the number of draws is sufficiently large. [Our textbook is vague about how large is "sufficiently large". For a box with a uniform distribution (that is, a histogram for which all the blocks are close to even in height), 25 draws or more is sufficiently large. For a box that is very uneven (that is, a histogram with blocks of very different heights), sufficiently large might be 100 or more draws.]</div>
