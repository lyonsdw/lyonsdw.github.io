<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Sampling theory derives its power from a fact called the <dfn class="terminology">Central Limit Theorem</dfn>. The Central Limit Theorem says that, no matter what numbers are in a box model, the histogram of all possible (standardized) sample sums (which is the same as the standardized sample average or the standardized sample percentage of 1's) is close to the standard normal distribution, as long as the number of draws is sufficiently large. [Our textbook is vague about how large is "sufficiently large". For a box with a uniform distribution (that is, a histogram for which all the blocks are close to even in height), 25 draws or more is sufficiently large. For a box that is very uneven (that is, a histogram with blocks of very different heights), sufficiently large might be 100 or more draws.]</p>
