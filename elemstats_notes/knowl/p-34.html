<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Sampling theory relies on the key formulas <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/expectedsumformula.html" title="Equation 4.1">(4.1)</a> and <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sesumformula.html" title="Equation 4.2">(4.2)</a> below that express the fundamental relationships between the contents of a box model and samples coming out of the box. First we have to introduce the quantities involved. The average of the list of all possible sample sums is called the <dfn class="terminology">expected sum</dfn> of the sample draws, which we will denote by "expected(sum)". The SD of the list of all sample sums is called the <dfn class="terminology">standard error (SE) for the sum</dfn> of the sample draws, which we will denote by "SE(sum)". Similarly, the average of the list of all sample averages is called the <dfn class="terminology">expected average</dfn>of the sample draws (denoted "expected(ave)") and the SD of the list of all sample averages is called the <dfn class="terminology">SE for the average</dfn> of the sample draws (denoted "SE(ave)"). For a box containing only 0's and 1's, the average of all the sample percentages of 1's is called the <dfn class="terminology">expected percentage of 1's</dfn> (denoted "expected(%1's)") and the SD of the list of all sample percentages of 1's is called the <dfn class="terminology">SE for the percentage of 1's</dfn> (denoted "SE(%1s)").</p>
