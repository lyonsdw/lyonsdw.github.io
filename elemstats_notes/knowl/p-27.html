<div class="para">The text uses the term "football-shaped" or "shaped like a football" very loosely throughout Ch 8â€“12 to describe a scatter diagram that has linear association. Worse, the term "football-shaped" is sometimes used to imply homoscedasticity. Even worse, "football-shaped" is used to imply that data in thin vertical strips in the scatter diagram is normally distributed (see the box on p.197). Because of this vagueness and ambiguity, we will instead use the terms "shows linear association", "homoscedastic", and "data in thin vertical strips is normally distributed" for these various attributes that may or may not apply to 2-variable data. In particular, in the box on p.197, and also in item 7 of the Ch 11 summary on p.201, replace the first sentence with "Suppose that a scatter diagram shows linear association, is homoscedastic, and data in thin vertical strips is normally distributed."</div>
