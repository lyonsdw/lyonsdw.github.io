This is called the <dfn class="terminology">regression effect</dfn>. Any attempt to explain why <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is between <span class="process-math">\(\AVE(X)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by any other reason than simply the fact that <span class="process-math">\(|r|\lt 1\)</span> is called a <dfn class="terminology">regression fallacy</dfn>. </div>
