<div class="para">Values for <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in the left column of the standard normal table are given in increments of <span class="process-math">\(0.05\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> values that fall between rows of the table, use an area estimate that is between the corresponding values in the area column. For example, <span class="process-math">\(z=.77\)</span> is between the row for <span class="process-math">\(z=.70\)</span> with area <span class="process-math">\(51.61\)</span> and the row for <span class="process-math">\(z=.75\)</span> with area <span class="process-math">\(57.63\text{,}\)</span> so a reasonable area estimate would be <span class="process-math">\(56\%\text{.}\)</span> Use a similar estimation procedure if you want to find a <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> value that corresponds to an area that falls between rows of the table. For example, the area <span class="process-math">\(80\%\)</span> falls between the row for area <span class="process-math">\(78.87\%\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(z=1.25\)</span> and the row for the area <span class="process-math">\(80.64\%\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(z=1.30\text{,}\)</span> so a reasonable <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> estimate would be <span class="process-math">\(z=1.27\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(z=1.28\text{.}\)</span> The procedure of reading between the rows is not technical, and might be off by a little bit, but it is better than rounding off to the values in the nearest row.</div>
