  <title>Batting Average Puzzle</title>

  <p>A player's <alert>batting average</alert> during a chosen time
    period is the fraction
    <me>\text{batting average} =
      \frac{\#\text{hits}}{\#\text{at-bats}}</me>
    where <q>#hits</q>
    is the number of hits achieved and <q>#at-bats</q>
     is the
      number of attempts during that time period. For example, if a
      player gets 3 hits in 10 at-bats, then the player's batting
    average is <m>3/10 = 0.300 = 30\%</m>.
  </p>

  <p><alert>Question:</alert> Is it possible for a player to have the
  highest 1-year batting average for two years in a row, and yet there
  is some other batter who has a higher 2-year average?
  </p>
  
  <p><alert>Puzzle:</alert> If possible, find <m>8</m>
    numbers <m>A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H</m> to fill in the table below
    so that Jane’s batting average is
  higher than Joe’s in both years 1 and 2, but Joe’s 2-year batting
    average is higher than Jane’s. That is, you need to make <m>\frac{B}{A} \gt \frac{F}{E}</m>,
    make <m>\frac{D}{C} \gt \frac{H}{G}</m>, and make <m>\frac{F+H}{E+G} \gt
    \frac{B+D}{A+C}</m>.
  </p>
