  <title>Displacement, Deviation</title>
<p>  Imagine walking along the number line from a starting
  point <m>A</m> to a final point <m>B</m>. The difference <m>B-A</m> is
  called the <term>displacement</term> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, or the 
  <term>deviation</term> of <m>B</m> from <m>A</m>. In words, the deviation
  of <m>B</m> from <m>A</m> is how far <m>B</m> is from <m>A</m> on the
  number line, with the directional information indicated by a plus or minus sign. If <m>B</m> is
  less than <m>A</m> (this is the same as <m>B</m> being to the left
  of <m>A</m> in the standard orientation of the number line), then the
  deviation of <m>B</m> from <m>A</m> is negative. Likewise, if <m>B</m>
  is greater than <m>A</m> (or <m>B</m> is to the right of <m>A</m>
  in the standard orientation of the number line), then the deviation
  of <m>B</m> from <m>A</m> is positive. Finally, if <m>B=A</m>, then
  the deviation of <m>B</m> from <m>A</m> is zero. See Figure <xref ref="displacement_fig"/>.</p>
