<subsection>
  <title>The Histogram</title>

  <p>
    A <term>histogram</term><idx><h>histogram</h>
    </idx>
    for a list of numbers <m>X</m>
    is a drawing with a collection
    of rectangles. The base of each rectangle is an interval, called a <term>class
      interval</term><idx><h>class interval</h>
    </idx>, of a horizontal axis whose units are the same
    as <m>X</m>
    (that is,
    if the numbers in <m>X</m>
    are dollars, or years, then the units of the
horizontal axis are dollars or years, etc). The area of a rectangle
    whose base is the class interval from <m>A</m>
    to <m>B</m>
    is the fraction of the
    numbers in the list <m>X</m>
    that lie between <m>A</m>
    and <m>B</m>. For example, if <m>40\%</m>
    of
    the numbers in the list <m>X</m>
    are in the range 10 to 30, then a rectangle in
    a histogram for <m>X</m>
    whose base is the class interval from 10 to 30 has
    area <m>0.4 = 40\%</m>, and therefore has a height of <m>.4/(30-10) = .02 = 2</m>
    percent per <m>X</m>
    unit.
The vertical axis in a histogram has units called
    <term>density</term><idx><h>density units</h>
    </idx>
    units. Rectangles in a histogram must be non-overlapping, and the
    total area of all the rectangles must be <m>100\%</m>. [See Example
    1 on p.40 of <xref ref="freedman_statistics"/> for an illustration.]

  <title>Average, Median, Percentiles</title>

  <p>
    The <term>average</term><idx><h>average</h>
    </idx>
    (also called
    the <term>mean</term><idx><h>mean</h>
    </idx>)
    of a list of numbers is the sum of all the numbers divided
    by the number of entries in the list. We
    write <m>\AVE(X)</m><notation><usage><m>\AVE(X)</m>
      </usage><description>the
	average of the list <m>X</m>
      </description>
    </notation>
    to denote the
    average of a list <m>X</m>. The average of the list <m>X</m>
    turns out to be the
    balance point of a histogram for <m>X</m>, in the following sense. Imagine the
rectangles of the histogram are made of uniformly thick clay. Glue the
rectangles together along the edges where they meet. This solid clay
histogram balances on a fulcrum placed at the average point on the
base. <fn>Technical assumption: the numbers that fall within each rectangle
base interval must be close to evenly distributed within that interval
      for this balance point interpretation to be valid.</fn> [See
    Figure 6 on p.63 of <xref ref="freedman_statistics"/> for an illustration.]
  </p>

  <p>
    Now suppose we have a histogram for a list <m>X</m>
    that has no rectangles of
    height zero. Suppose that <m>L</m>
    is the location, along the horizontal axis,
    of the left edge of the left-most rectangle in the histogram,
    and <m>R</m>
    is
    the location of the right edge of the right-most rectangle. A number <m>A</m>
in the range
    <me>  L \leq A \leq R</me>
    is said to
    have <m>p</m>-th <term>percentile rank</term><idx><h>percentile rank</h></idx>
    if the area of the histogram on the
    interval from <m>L</m>
    to <m>A</m>
    is <m>p</m>
    percent. The <term>median</term><idx><h>median</h></idx>
    of the list <m>X</m>
    is the
    number with 50th percentile rank. The <term>interquartile
      range</term><idx><h>interquartile range</h></idx>
    of a list <m>X</m>
    is
    the length of the interval from <m>A</m>
    to <m>B</m>, where <m>A</m>
    has 25th percentile rank and <m>B</m>
    has
75th percentile rank.<fn>Note: these definitions of percentile and median are
      dependent on the histogram that is chosen.</fn>

  <title>Operations on Lists</title>
  
  <p>
    Given lists <m>X,Y</m>
    with the same number of entries, and given constants <m>a,b</m>, we can form
    new lists <m>X^2</m>, <m>aX+b</m>, and <m>XY</m>
    by doing the obvious operations on the
    entries of the list(s). For example, if <m>X = -2,1,3</m>
    and <m>Y = 1,4,0</m>, then
we have the following lists.

    <md>
      <mrow>X \amp = -2,1,3</mrow>
      <mrow>Y \amp = 1,4,0</mrow>
      <mrow>X^2 \amp = (-2)^2,1^2,3^3 = 4,1,9</mrow>
      <mrow>2X - 3 \amp = 2(-2)-3, 2(1)-3, 2(3)-3 = -7,-1,3</mrow>
      <mrow>XY \amp = (-2)(1),(1)(4),(3)(0) = -2,4,0</mrow>
</md>

  <p>  The <term>root mean square</term><idx><h>root mean square</h>
    </idx>
    of a list <m>X</m>,
    denoted <m>\rms(X)</m><notation><usage><m>\rms(X)</m>
      </usage><description>root
	mean square of the list <m>X</m>
      </description>
    </notation>, is the square root of
    the average of the list <m>X^2</m>. Here is <m>\rms(X)</m>
    in symbols.

    <me>  \rms(X) = \sqrt{\AVE(X^2)}</me>

<subsection><title>Standard Deviation and Standard Units</title>
  <p>
    The <term>standard deviation</term><idx><h>standard deviation</h>
    </idx>
    of a list <m>X</m>,
    denoted <m>\SD(X)</m><notation><usage><m>\SD(X)</m>
      </usage><description>standard
	deviation of the list <m>X</m>
      </description>
    </notation>, is the rms of the
    list <m>X-\AVE(X)</m>. The list <m>X-\AVE(X)</m>
    is called the list of <term>deviations from
      average</term>. Here is <m>\SD(X)</m>
    in symbols.
    <me>  \SD(X) = \rms(X-\AVE(X))</me>

The standard deviation is interpreted as a the (absolute) size of a
typical error, that is, distance from average, in a game of chance where
    you draw entries from the list <m>X</m>
    at random.
</p>

  <p>The list <m>X</m>
    in <term>standard units</term><idx><h>standard units</h>
    </idx>
    is the list <m>\frac{X-\AVE(X)}{\SD(X)}</m>.</p>

<subsection>
  <title>The Standard Normal Distribution</title>

  <p>
    A list <m>X</m>
    is said to follow a <term>normal distribution</term><idx><h>normal distribution</h>
    </idx>
    if the percent of entries
between pairs of numbers
    <me>  -z=-\frac{A-\AVE(X)}{\SD(X)},\;\;+z=+\frac{A-\AVE(X)}{\SD(X)} </me>
    in the list <m>(X-\AVE(X))/\SD(X)</m>
    is close to the numbers given in the
    standard normal table in the Appendix of the textbook, for every entry <m>A</m>
    in the list <m>X</m>.
