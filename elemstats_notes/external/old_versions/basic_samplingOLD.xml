    <title>The Law of Averages (Ch 16,17)</title>
    <p>In Chapter 16, the text says that with repeated chance processes,
    the absolute error goes up as the number of draws increases, and the
    relative error goes down as the number of draws increases. The
    authors call this statement the "Law of Averages". The
    language is vague, but the authors presume that the statements
    are intuitive, and the reader is supposed to get the meaning
    through examples in the reading. Using the square root law from
    Chapter 17, we can clarify the meaning of the Law of Averages.
    </p>

    <p>In a box model, with random draws (taken with replacement), we have
<md>
  <mrow>\text{ expected(sum of draws) }\amp = (\text{average of the box}) \cdot (\text{number of draws})</mrow>
  <mrow>\text{ SE(sum of draws) } \amp  = (\text{SD of the box}) \sqrt{\text{number of draws}}.</mrow>
</md>
      The absolute error and the relative error are 
<md>
  <mrow>\text{ absolute error }\amp = (\text{actual sum of draws)} -(\text{expected(sum of draws)})</mrow>
  <mrow>\text{ relative error } \amp  = \frac{ \text{absolute error}
  }{\text{number of draws}}.</mrow>
</md>
The absolute error is estimated by
<me>\text{ absolute error }\approx
  \text{ SE(sum of draws) }=(\text{SD of the box}) \sqrt{\text{number of draws}}. </me>
Dividing both sides of the last equation by <m>\text{(number of
  draws)}</m>, we have<fn>For the final "equals" on the right, use this algebra
  fact: <me>\frac{1}{\sqrt{A}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{A}}\frac{\sqrt{A}}{\sqrt{A}}=\frac{\sqrt{A}}{A}.</me>
  Apply this fact to <m>A=\text{(number of draws)}</m>.
</fn>
<me>\text{ relative error }\approx \frac{(\text{SD of the
  box})\sqrt{\text{number of draws}} }{\text{number of draws}} = \frac{(\text{SD of the
  box}) }{\sqrt{\text{number of draws}}}</me>. Summarizing, we have
<md>
  <mrow>\text{ absolute error }\amp \approx (\text{SD of the box}) \sqrt{\text{number of draws}}</mrow>
  <mrow>\text{ relative error }\amp \approx \frac{(\text{SD of the
  box}) }{\sqrt{\text{number of draws}}}.</mrow>
</md>
From the last two equations, we can see clearly that the absolute error
goes up and the relative error goes down as the number of draws increases.

<subsection>  <title>A special case SD formula (Ch 17)</title>
  <p>
    Suppose that all of the entries of a list <me>X=A,A,A,\ldots,A,B,B,B,\ldots, B</me>
  are one of two values <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, with <m>A\lt B</m>, and
  suppose there are <m>r</m> entries with value <m>A</m> and <m>s</m>
  entries with value <m>B</m>, so that the total number of entries in
  the list <m>X</m> is <m>r+s</m>. The SD of the list <m>X</m> is given by
  the following formula.
  <men>\text{SD}(X)=
  (B-A)\sqrt{\left(\frac{r}{r+s}\right)\left(\frac{s}{r+s}\right)} =
    (B-A)\frac{\sqrt{rs}}{r+s}</men>
  In the Freedman text (p.298), the number <m>B</m> is called the "big number",
  the number <m>A</m> is called the "small number", the
  fraction <m>s/(r+s)</m> is called the "fraction with the big number"
  and the fraction <m>r/(r+s)</m> is called the "fraction with the small number".

<exercise>
  <p>On every 6th roll (that is, on roll numbers 6, 12, 18, etc) you
  win a blue marble if exactly half of the last 6 rolls came up
  even. The chance that you win 35 or more blue marbles in 600 rolls
  is <fillin/>. Use the continuity correction to be as precise as
    possible.</p>
