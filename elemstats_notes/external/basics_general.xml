  <title>Rounding in calculations
</title>

<p>Roundoff errors made at intermediate steps of a multi-step
  calculation tend to become magnified. For this reason, do not round
  off numbers until the final step of a calculation, unless
  you are simply making a rough estimate. If you must round, keep lots
  of digits. A rule of thumb is to round to the nearest <m>0.001</m>,
  that is, to the nearest 3rd digit to the right of the decimal point.

  <title>Solving equations
  </title>

  <p>To solve a given equation for a particular quantity <m>X</m> means to
    manipulate the given equation into a new equation where <m>X</m> is
    all by itself on one side. For example, the equation <m>A=BC</m> can
    be solved for <m>C</m> by dividing both sides of the equation
    by <m>B</m> (this is valid as long as <m>B</m> is not zero). This
    manipulation results in the new equation <m>C=\frac{A}{B}</m> which
    is solved for <m>C</m>.
    </p>

  <p>
    To solve the
    equation <me>Z=\frac{X-M}{S}</me> for <m>X</m>, first multiply both
    sides of the equation by <m>S</m> to obtain
    <me>ZS = X-M</me>
    then add <m>M</m> to both sides to obtain
    <me>X=ZS+M.</me>
