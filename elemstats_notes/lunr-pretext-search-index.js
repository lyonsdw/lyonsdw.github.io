For this reason, do not round off numbers until the final step of a calculation, unless you are simply making a rough estimate. If you must round, keep lots of digits. A rule of thumb is to round to the nearest , that is, to the nearest 3rd digit to the right of the decimal point.    Solving equations  To solve a given equation for a particular quantity means to manipulate the given equation into a new equation where is all by itself on one side. For example, the equation can be solved for by dividing both sides of the equation by (this is valid as long as is not zero). This manipulation results in the new equation which is solved for .  To solve the equation for , first multiply both sides of the equation by to obtain then add to both sides to obtain    Solving equations practice problems  Consider the equation . Solve for .

Use a similar estimation procedure if you want to find a value that corresponds to an area that falls between rows of the table. For example, the area falls between the row for area for and the row for the area for , so a reasonable estimate would be or . The procedure of reading between the rows is not technical, and might be off by a little bit, but it is better than rounding off to the values in the nearest row.  When calculating a value for normal data, you may round to the nearest 0.01, because that is the level of accuracy in the column of the normal table. When calculating an area under the normal curve, you may usually round the final answer to the nearest whole percent. These practices are exceptions to the usual roundoff advice .

  "body": " Regression   Terminology: the term \"football-shaped\"   The text uses the term \"football-shaped\" or \"shaped like a football\" very loosely throughout Ch 8 12 to describe a scatter diagram that has linear association. Worse, the term \"football-shaped\" is sometimes used to imply homoscedasticity. Even worse, \"football-shaped\" is used to imply that data in thin vertical strips in the scatter diagram is normally distributed (see the box on p.197). Because of this vagueness and ambiguity, we will instead use the terms \"shows linear association\", \"homoscedastic\", and \"data in thin vertical strips is normally distributed\" for these various attributes that may or may not apply to 2-variable data. In particular, in the box on p.197, and also in item 7 of the Ch 11 summary on p.201, replace the first sentence with \"Suppose that a scatter diagram shows linear association, is homoscedastic, and data in thin vertical strips is normally distributed.\"   Examples  Here are some basic problem types about regression.  (Ch 10) The scatter diagram for data called shows a linear association, with the following summary statistics.  Estimate the average value for data whose value is near .  Estimate the average value for data whose value is near .     (Ch 10) Suppose that data called have a linear association with a correlation of , and that are both approximately normally distributed.

For data whose value is near , estimate the percent of data in the range and higher.    Here are the solutions. Here are the drawing method solution steps taught in the textbook.   Use the facts that the regression line passes close to vertical centers of thin vertical strips, that the regression line passes through the point of averages , and has slope equal to . Let be the point of averages and let be the point on the regression line with , so that is the -coordinate we are looking for. The run is , the rise is , and .

For example, here are the 12 possible outcomes for 2 draws, without replacement, from the box . (This is a box model for \"two cards are dealt from a 4-card deck containing an ace, a king, a queen, and a jack\".) In this notation, means the ace is drawn first, and the king second, while means the king is first and the ace is second.  An event is a set of outcomes. For example, the events \"get a queen\" and \"get a king on the first draw\" are Another example is the event \"get the hand ace-king\". In a \"hand\", it does not matter what order the cards are dealt in, so we have To say that two events and \"both happen\" can be rephrased . To say that \"at least one of the events happens\" can be rephrased . For example, for the events we have the following. [Comment for students who know about intersection and union of sets: the event is the same thing as the intersection of the sets , and the event is the same thing as the union of the sets .]  We will use the correct terms \"outcome\" and \"event\" instead of the vague term \"thing\" used in the text in Ch 13.  We will write to denote the probability for an event . For example, in the game of 2 draws, with replacement, from the box , the probability of the single outcome is because there are 12 equally likely outcomes for the 2 draws. The probability for getting the hand ace-king is because there are 2 equally likely outcomes in the event \"get the hand ace-king\", and there are 12 equally likely outcomes in all for the 2 draws. The probability of getting a queen is because there are 6 equally likely outcomes in the event \"get a queen\". The probability of getting king on the first draw is because there are 3 equally likely outcomes in the event \"get a king on draw 1\".  The textbook does not give a definition of the term conditional probability; instead, they explain by example in Ch 13 Sec. 2 (p.226). Here is the definition: The conditional probability of event given that event has happened, denoted , is where the event \" \" is the set of all outcomes that belong to both events and . For example, in 2 draws with replacement from the box , we have because there is 1 outcome, namely , that has a , among the 3 outcomes that have on draw 1. We also have because there is 1 outcome, namely , for which draw 1 is a , among the 6 outcomes that have a .  The definitions of independent and dependent events (box on p.230) should be replaced by the following: \"Two events are independent if . Otherwise, the events are dependent .\" Or in words, \"Two events are independent if the probability of given that has happened is equal to the probability of . Otherwise, the events are dependent.\"    Probability Practice Problems    Problems 1 and 2 are about the following situation: A box contains seven tickets, labeled . In Game 1, tickets are drawn from the box with replacement. In Game 2, tickets are drawn without replacement. On any given draw, every ticket remaining in the box is equally likely to be selected on the next draw. Consider the following events.    Find the probabilities in the table below. Give your answer as a percent, correct to the nearest (that is, rounded to the two decimal places). Two entries have been filled in as examples.

The language is vague, but the authors presume that the statements are intuitive, and the reader is supposed to get the meaning through examples in the reading. Using the square root law from Chapter 17, we can clarify the meaning of the Law of Averages.  In a box model, with random draws (taken with replacement), we have The absolute error and the relative error are The absolute error is estimated by Dividing both sides of the last equation by , we have For the final \"equals\" on the right, use this algebra fact: Apply this fact to .  . Summarizing, we have From the last two equations, we can see clearly that the absolute error goes up and the relative error goes down as the number of draws increases.

In the Freedman text (p.298), the number is called the \"big number\", the number is called the \"small number\", the fraction is called the \"fraction with the big number\" and the fraction is called the \"fraction with the small number\".  Recommendation: Using the words \"big\" and \"small\" to refer to the values and can be misleading (the negative number is \"bigger\", in the sense of absolute size, than the positive number ). Instead, use the words \"higher\" and \"lower\", to refer to numbers that are further to the right or further to the left, respectively, on the number line.

The Histogram  A histogram histogram  for a list of numbers is a drawing with a collection of rectangles. The base of each rectangle is an interval, called a class interval class interval  , of a horizontal axis whose units are the same as (that is, if the numbers in are dollars, or years, then the units of the horizontal axis are dollars or years, etc). The area of a rectangle whose base is the class interval from to is the fraction of the numbers in the list that lie between and . For example, if of the numbers in the list are in the range 10 to 30, then a rectangle in a histogram for whose base is the class interval from 10 to 30 has area , and therefore has a height of percent per unit. The vertical axis in a histogram has units called density density units  units. Rectangles in a histogram must be non-overlapping, and the total area of all the rectangles must be . [See Example 1 on p.40 of for an illustration.]    Average, Median, Percentiles  The average average  (also called the mean mean  ) of a list of numbers is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of entries in the list. We write  the average of the list   to denote the average of a list . The average of the list turns out to be the balance point of a histogram for , in the following sense. Imagine the rectangles of the histogram are made of uniformly thick clay. Glue the rectangles together along the edges where they meet. This solid clay histogram balances on a fulcrum placed at the average point on the base. Technical assumption: the numbers that fall within each rectangle base interval must be close to evenly distributed within that interval for this balance point interpretation to be valid. [See Figure 6 on p.63 of for an illustration.]  Now suppose we have a histogram for a list that has no rectangles of height zero. Suppose that is the location, along the horizontal axis, of the left edge of the left-most rectangle in the histogram, and is the location of the right edge of the right-most rectangle. A number in the range is said to have -th percentile rank percentile rank if the area of the histogram on the interval from to is percent. The median median of the list is the number with 50th percentile rank. The interquartile range interquartile range of a list is the length of the interval from to , where has 25th percentile rank and has 75th percentile rank. Note: these definitions of percentile and median are dependent on the histogram that is chosen. [See Example 10 on p. 90 of for an illustration.]    Operations on Lists  Given lists with the same number of entries, and given constants , we can form new lists , , and by doing the obvious operations on the entries of the list(s). For example, if and , then we have the following lists.   The root mean square root mean square  of a list , denoted  root mean square of the list   , is the square root of the average of the list . Here is in symbols.    Standard Deviation and Standard Units  The standard deviation standard deviation  of a list , denoted  standard deviation of the list   , is the rms of the list . The list is called the list of deviations from average . Here is in symbols. The standard deviation is interpreted as a the (absolute) size of a typical error, that is, distance from average, in a game of chance where you draw entries from the list at random.  The list in standard units standard units  is the list .    The Standard Normal Distribution  A list is said to follow a normal distribution normal distribution  if the percent of entries between pairs of numbers in the list is close to the numbers given in the standard normal table in the Appendix of the textbook, for every entry in the list .

RMS Error of Fit  Given two lists of numbers with the same number of entries, and given a linear function ( and are constants), the rms error for the line rms error for a line is the rms of the list . (For example, if is an entry in the list and is the corresponding entry in the list , then the corresponding entry in the list is .) We interpret the rms error for a line as a measure of how well performs as a tool for predicting the value that corresponds to a given value. Given an value , the value has a \"prediction error\" equal to . The line is a good prediction tool if the rms error for is low, and the line is a bad prediction tool if the rms error for is high. We interpret the rms error for a line as the size of the typical error that we would observe if we used to predict an unknown value for a given value.   The Regression Line  Among all possible lines, there is one single line with the least possible rms error, called the regression line for on  the regression line . This means that the regression line is the best possible line to use as a prediction tool to guess an unknown corresponding value for a given value. The regression line passes through the point , called the point of averages point of averages  for the lists , and has slope equal to , where is the number called the correlation coefficient correlation coefficient  for the pair of lists . The rms error for the regression line is     The Scatter Diagram  The list of pairs of points from the lists is called the scatter diagram scatter diagram  of the lists . The scatter diagram is said to show linear association linear association  if the points are scattered roughly symmetrically about a linear axis. The size of the correlation coefficient determines the tightness or looseness of scattering of points about the regression line. For near 1, points in the scatter diagram are tightly clustered about the regression line. As approaches 0, the scatter diagram is more and more loosely clustered about the regression line.   A thin vertical strip thin vertical strip  in the scatter diagram is a set of points whose -coordinate lies in a range from , where is a number within the range of entries of the list and is a small increment. If the various sets of values in thin vertical strips (for various values of ) has a similar SD as varies, the scatter diagram is said to be homoscedastic homoscedastic .

The graph of residuals is the set of points . You can see linear association and homoscedasticity (or the lack of either one) very plainly in the graph of residuals: data lists have a linear association if the graph of residuals is roughly symmetric across the -axis; and the data are homoscedastic if the graph of residuals has fairly even densities and vertical ranges in thin vertical strips across the horizontal range of .   shows a comparison of three lines and their rms errors.

  "body": " Probability  This section is coordinated with Freedman, Statistics  , Chapters 13 15.   Box Models  A box model box model  consists of a box that contains tickets, each of which is equally likely to be selected on any single random draw from the box, as in a fair lottery or raffle. In this course, every chance process can be modeled in terms of a sequence of one or more random draws from a box of tickets. The sequence of draws can be conducted in two different ways: with replacement with replacement  or without replacement without replacement  . These terms refer to whether or not each ticket drawn from the box is replaced in the box before the next draw; either way, it is assumed that on any given draw, every ticket in the box at that moment has an equal chance to be selected.  The outcome outcome  of a sequence of random draws is the list of specific tickets that were drawn. That is, an outcome is a list of the form The assumption that each ticket is equally likely to be selected on any given random draw implies that every draw sequence outcome is equally likely. A set of outcomes is called an event event . We say an event happens happens  or occurs occurs  if a sequence of random draws produces an outcome that belongs to that event. The probability probability (that an event occurs) that an event occurs is the fraction We usually use capital letters to denote events. We write to denote the probability of an event . Here is the basic definition of probability using these symbols.    Consider the box with tickets labeled and consider the chance process that selects two tickets, without replacement, from the box. The set of all possible outcomes is where the pair , for example, denotes the outcome where is selected on the first draw, and is selected on the second draw. The event is the set and the event is the set We have the following probabilities.   The point of the rest of this section is that we want to avoid having to explicitly list and count outcomes in order to calculate probabilities; we want to use shortcuts instead. First, we need more vocabulary.    Complement, Intersection, Union of Events  The opposite opposite of an event  of an event (also called the complement complement  of ) is the event that consists of all the outcomes not in . For two events , the event (also called the intersection intersection of events  of and ) is the set of all the outcomes shared by both and . The event (also called the union union of events  of and ) is the set of all the outcomes that are in or in or both. Events are called mutually exclusive if the event is empty.  Continuing , consider these events. The we have the following. The event is the empty set, so are mutually exclusive.     Conditional Probability  Suppose we are about to make a sequence of draws from a box model and we are considering the probability that the outcome will be in some event . Using definition , we have this. Suppose now that we are somehow guaranteed that the outcome of our draws will be in a particular event , and that all of the outcomes in are equally likely. This effectively reduces the pool of possible outcomes: any outcome that is not in should not be considered in the top or the bottom of the fraction on the right side of . We define the conditional probability of V given U conditional probability  , denoted conditional probability of given , to be The conditional probability reflects our updated assessment of the likelihood that the outcome of our sequence of draws will be in , in the presence of the knowledge that the outcome is in . Dividing the top and bottom of the fraction on the right side of by the total number of possible outcomes yields the following expression for conditional probability.   Continuing and , we have the following.    Independent and Dependent Events  If , the events are called independent independent events  . Otherwise, the events are called dependent dependent events . Using the word \"independent\" to describe events reflects the fact that knowing whether or not an outcome is guaranteed to be in event does not affect the way we assess the probability of event .    Probability Rules  The usefulness of the following equations is when something you want to know can be put in the form of the expressions on the left sides, and the expressions on the right sides are easier to compute. Most of the time, these rules save you from having to make explicit lists and counts of outcomes.  Rearranging , we have the following equation, called the multiplication rule multiplication rule . If are independent, the multiplication rule simplifies a little. If are mutually exclusive, we have the following equation, called the addition rule for mutually exclusive events addition rule (for mutually exclusive events) . A special case of the addition rule is when is the opposite of . In this case, is the set of all possible outcomes, so . Rearranging the addition rule terms, we have the opposite rule opposite rule .     The Binomial Formula  Consider a box model in which the tickets are divided into two categories: (for winning tickets) and for (losing tickets). Let be the probability that a single random draw is a winning ticket. In symbols we have the following.   Now consider a sequence of random draws, with replacement. Let be the number of draws in the sequence ( is some positive whole number), and let be the event where is some whole number in the range from 0 to . For example, the outcome belongs to for and . The binomial formula is where is the quantity The number , called a binomial coefficient binomial coefficient , is the number of different -letter words you can write with  's and  's. For example, the number of different 5-letter words you can write with  's and  's is Indeed, here is the list of the 10 words. For the box with 1 and 3 's (so ), the chance of getting exactly  's in draws is   Here is the reasoning for why the binomial formula works, in brief: There are outcomes with  's and  's. All of these outcomes are mutually exclusive to one another, so the probability of getting an outcome sequence with exactly  's in in draws is the sum of the probabilities of each individual outcome (by the addition rule). Any particular sequence of  's and  's has a probability of (by the multiplication rule for independent events). Put all this together and you get the binomial formula.   "

Sampling Vocabulary and Formulas  A sequence of random draws from a box model is called a sample sample  from the box. A sequence of random draws taken without replacement is called a simple random sample simple random sample . The sample sum sample sum is the sum of the draws. The sample average sample average  is the average of the draws. For a box whose tickets are labeled with 0's and 1's, the percentage of 1's drawn in a sample is called the sample percentage of 1's sample percentage of 1's  .   Box contents: All possible samples of size 2, with replacement: All possible sample sums: All possible sample averages:    The sample sum, the sample average, and the sample percentage of 1's are examples of statistics . A statistic statistic  is any number that is computed from a sample. Another important statistic is the sample SD (the SD of the list of draws). By contrast, any number that can be computed from the numbers in the box is called a parameter parameter . For example, the average and the SD of the numbers in the box are parameters. Sampling theory is the art of exploiting the relationships between parameters and statistics to do these two kinds of tasks.  Prediction: prediction  If you know what is in a given box, calculate the probability that a given statistic will fall in a given range of values.   Inference: inference  If you do not know all the details of the contents of a box, but you have access to one or more samples from the box, make educated guesses about the parameters of the box.    Sampling theory relies on the key formulas and below that express the fundamental relationships between the contents of a box model and samples coming out of the box. First we have to introduce the quantities involved. The average of the list of all possible sample sums is called the expected sum expected sum (of sample draws) of the sample draws, which we will denote by \"expected(sum)\"  expected sum of sample draws  . The SD of the list of all sample sums is called the standard error (SE) for the sum standard error (SE) for the sum (of sample draws) of the sample draws, which we will denote by \"SE(sum)\"  standard error for the sum of sample draws  . Similarly, the average of the list of all sample averages is called the expected average expected average (of sample draws)  of the sample draws (denoted \"expected(ave)\"  expected average of sample draws ) and the SD of the list of all sample averages is called the SE for the average standard error (SE) for the average (of sample draws)  of the sample draws (denoted \"SE(ave)\"  standard error for the average of sample draws  ). For a box containing only 0's and 1's, the average of all the sample percentages of 1's is called the expected percentage of 1's expected percentage of 1's (of sample draws) (denoted \"expected(%1's)\"  expected percentage of 1's for sample draws ) and the SD of the list of all sample percentages of 1's is called the SE for the percentage of 1's standard error (SE) for the percentage of 1's (of sample draws) (denoted \"SE(%1s)\"  standard error for the percentage of 1's (of sample draws) ).  For , we have the following.   For samples with replacement, we have the following formulas. Equation is called the Square Root Law Square Root Law .  For samples without replacement, there is no change in formula , but each of the equations in is replaced by where the correction factor correction factor  is given by the following. where   The reason we say that and are just two equations and not six is because of the simple relationships between sum, average, and percentage of 1's. The average of a list of numbers is the sum of that list of numbers divided by the number of items in the list; the percentage of 1's (in a list of 0's and 1's) is the average of that same list of 0's and 1's times 100%. Applying these simple relationships (summarized in equation , below) to the first of the three equations in each of and produces the rest of the equations in and .   Many sampling problems use a box model with only two different values on the tickets contained in the box. In this case, it is useful to have the following \"short-cut\" SD formula.    The Central Limit Theorem  Sampling theory derives its power from a fact called the Central Limit Theorem Central Limit Theorem . The Central Limit Theorem says that, no matter what numbers are in a box model, the histogram of all possible (standardized) sample sums (which is the same as the standardized sample average or the standardized sample percentage of 1's) is close to the standard normal distribution, as long as the number of draws is sufficiently large. [Our textbook is vague about how large is \"sufficiently large\". For a box with a uniform distribution (that is, a histogram for which all the blocks are close to even in height), 25 draws or more is sufficiently large. For a box that is very uneven (that is, a histogram with blocks of very different heights), sufficiently large might be 100 or more draws.]    Basic prediction problem  Armed with the facts and formulas above, here is the skeleton of the basic prediction problem.  Given: a description of a chance process  Question: find the probability that a sample (with a sufficiently large number of draws) from a box model for the chance process produces a sum or average in a given range  The procedure to solve the problem has these steps: Construct the box model that matches the question. How many tickets are in the box? What numbers are on the tickets? How many draws? Are the draws taken with or without replacement? Is the question about the sum or the average of the draws?  Perform calculations.  ave(box)  SD(box)  expected(sum,ave,%1's) (using )  SE(sum,ave,%1's) (using and also if draws are without replacement)    Sketch a normal curve (justified by the Central Limit Theorem) and shade an area that answers the question. The center of the horizontal axis is expected(sum,ave,%1's)) (depending on the question). Find the values needed for your shaded area.   Finally, use the normal distribution table to find the area that answers the given question.      Basic Inference Problem  The basic inferential statistics problem in our text goes like this: you are given information about a sample from a box with unknown contents. You are asked to estimate the average of the box, and to make an educated statement about how far off that estimate might be from the actual value.  Let's write ave(observed) and SD(observed) to denote the average and SD of the list of numbers in the given sample. By virtue of Equation , it is intuitively reasonable to use ave(observed) to estimate ave(box). It is not so clear, but it turns out to be okay for large enough samples, to use SD(observed) to estimate SD(box). By , it makes sense that our actual ave(observed) will be off from the ave(box) by SE(ave), which we can estimate by (times the correction factor, if sampling without replacement). Equation is called the bootstrap estimate bootstrap estimate for the SE of the sample average.  It makes intuitive sense to report our estimate of ave(box) as follows. For a positive number , let's write Area( ) to denote the area under the normal curve in the range to . The interval is called an Area( ) confidence interval for ave(box) confidence interval . For example, a 95% confidence interval for the average of the box is the observed sample average plus or minus 2 times the estimated SE for the sample average.  By virtue of the Central Limit Theorem, we can make a precise probability statement about the interval . We can say that approximately Area( ) (time 100 percent) of all Area( ) confidence intervals (imagine many samples of the given sample size) will contain the average of the box. For example, approximately 95% of all 95% confidence intervals (calculated from many samples) will contain the box average.   "

This means that of people with mutation M will test negative, and of people who do not have mutation M will test positive. As part of a medical study with randomly selected participants, Skylar takes test T and the result is positive (that is, the test indicates that Skylar has mutation M). Before getting the positive test result, the best estimate of the chance that Skylar has mutation M is in , which is . How does the positive test result change this estimate?  Problem : Estimate the chance that Skylar has mutation M, knowing that Skylar tested positive for mutation M.  To solve the problem, consider what would happen if everyone in a population of million people got the test for mutation M? Let’s name these subgroups of the population.  : people who have mutation M  : people who do not have mutation M  : people whose test result is positive   : people whose test result is negative  It will be helpful to consider further subdivisions of these groups of people.   : people in group A who test positive   : people in group A who test negative   : people in group B who test positive   : people in group B who test negative    Solve the problem.   Estimate how many people are in each group. Hint: start with groups and , then do , , , , then do and last.  Now solve the Problem using the numbers from part 1. Give your solution as a percent, and write a sentence or two to express your reasoning.  Would your answer change if you thought about a population of million instead of million?

  "body": " Intuition for Average and SD  A data list is a sequence of numbers, called the entries in the list. For example, the sequence is a data list with four entries. The sum of a list is the total of all the entries. The average of a list is the sum of the list divided by the number of entries. For a given number , the deviations of a list from is the list with subtracted from each value in X. We write the sum, average, and deviations like this for .   Here are two useful concepts to visualize a data list .  A box model for is a box that contains tickets with the entries of the list printed on the tickets. We imagine a lottery game, taking random draws  with replacement from the box. This means that every ticket in the box has the same chance to be selected on every draw.  A dot plot for is a number line with dots placed at locations given by the entries in the list. We imagine that the number line is a see-saw and that the dots are small, identical weights stuck to the see-saw. Physics says that the see-saw is balanced on a fulcrum at the point if the sum of the deviations of from is zero.     Box model and dot plot for      Problems: Let be the data list , and suppose we take random draws with replacement from the box model for .  Among the random draws, what is the expected number of ’s that will be drawn? The expected number of ’s? The expected number of ’s?  What is the expected sum total of all draws?  Suppose you win the amount of money, in dollars, that is equal to the sum total of the random draws. What is the amount of your per-game winning? (Your per-game winning is the amount , such that if you won the amount  times in a row, would give you the same total as the draws from the box model for ?)  Does the see-saw for the dot plot of balance at the point ? At the point ? At the point ?  Suppose that, for every one of the draws, you have to guess a number before the draw (your guess does not have to be one of the values in the list ). After the number is drawn, you have to pay the square of the amount by which your guess is off, in dollars. For example, if you guess and then a is drawn, you have to pay . It is not obvious, but it turns out that the best strategy for making your total cost as low as possible is to guess the average value of every time. Try it out! Play the game times, say, guessing every time, and keep track of the total cost. Play another times, guessing however you like. Then play times, guessing the average of every time. Now compare the total costs. Which one is best?    "
