	<p><alert>Puzzle:</alert> Put your solutions to the following
	  questions in the appropriate entry in the table below. Some of
	  the entries are already shown. 
	  <ol>
	    <li>For each of the configurations (a), (b), (c), and (d),
	    find the point on the horizontal axis where a
	    single vertical line cuts the area of the configuration in
	      half, by percent. That is, find the vertical line that
	    puts <m>50\%</m> of the area on the left of the line, and
	      puts <m>50\%</m> of the area on the right. For example, a
	      vertical line at the point <m>5.0</m> cuts configuration
	      (a) into two halves that both have <m>50\%</m> of the
	    total area. Notice that dividing the area in half is not the
	    same as cutting in the middle from left to right: in
	      configuration (b), the <m>50</m><ndash/><m>50</m> area cut
	      is at the point <m>1.0</m>, which is <em>not</em> half-way
	    between the left and right ends of the configuration.
	      Put answers to this question in the middle row
	    of the table below.
	    </li>
	    <li>Do the same as in question 1, but find the location of
	      the line that
	      puts <m>25\%</m> of the area on the left, and <m>75\%</m>
	      on the right. For configuration (a), this location
	      is <m>4.0</m>. 
	      These answers go in the second row of the table.
	    </li>
	    <li>Do the same as above, but for a left-right area
	      percentage split of <m>20</m><ndash/><m>80</m>. Put
	      answers in the first row of the table.
	    </li>
	    <li>Again, but for <m>75</m><ndash/><m>25</m>. Fourth row.
	    </li>
	    <li>And one more time, for <m>80</m><ndash/><m>20</m>, fifth row.
	    </li>	    
	  </ol>
