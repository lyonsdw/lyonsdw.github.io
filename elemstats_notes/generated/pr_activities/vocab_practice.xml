    Usage notes: Vocabulary practice can be used at any time for an in-class
    activity. One version goes like this.
    <ul>
      <li>5 minutes: without consulting the text(s) or your notes, write
	definitions, facts, and example for some of the items in this
	section. </li>
      <li>5 minutes: Use the text(s) to correct your own responses.</li>
      <li>5 minutes: Volunteers share one or more items on the
      board. Brief summary discussion.</li>
    </ul>
    For variations, have people work in small groups for either or both
    of the first two phases. Ask students to give page references for
    definitions and facts.
