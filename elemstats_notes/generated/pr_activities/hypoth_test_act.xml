  <title>Intuition for Hypothesis Testing</title>

  <p><alert>Problem 1, part 1.</alert>
    Your first assignment in your new lab job is to perform 
    measurements of a check weight. The average of 50 weighings
    is <m>100.432</m> grams and the SD of those weighings is <m>0.04</m>
    grams. Use your data to find a <m>95\%</m>-confidence interval for the true value of the
    mass of the check weight.
  </p>

  <p><alert>Problem 2 part 1.</alert> Your first assignment in your new job
  with the Gambling Inspection Commission is to test a particular roulette wheel
  for fairness. In 250 test spins, the outcome is red 110 times. Use
    this data to find a <m>95\%</m>-confidence interval for the probability that
  a spin of this wheel will land red.
  </p>

  <p>
    <alert>Problem 1, part 2.</alert> After your 50 measurements in
    Problem 1, part 1, your coworker gives you more data about this
    check weight, obtained with the same apparatus and the same methods
    that you used for your measurements. The coworker's data claims
    that, over many weighings, the average value is <m>100.413</m> grams,
    and the SD is <m>0.038</m> grams. It occurs to you to perform a
    reality check on your own work. Supposing that the coworker's claims
    are correct, what is the chance that 50 measurements would have an
    average of <m>100.432</m> grams (your observed average) or higher?
  </p>

  <p>
    <alert>Problem 2, part 2.</alert> After your 250 test spins in
    Problem 2, part 1, a coworker tells you that this same wheel has
    been tested many times, and it is fair. In particular, this wheel
    lands red the expected percentage of the time. Supposing that this coworker
    is right, what is the chance that 250 spins would produce 110 reds
    or fewer?
  </p>

  <p>
    <alert>Both Problems, part 3.</alert> Perform a hypothesis test to
    determine whether the difference between your observed experimental values and the
    values expected by the coworker's claims are significant. Using one
    or more complete sentences, state a
    null hypothesis, find the observed level of significance, and state
    your conclusion.

    <alert>Problem 1.</alert>
    The estimated SE for the sample average
    is <m>.04/\sqrt{50}\approx .00566</m>. The <m>95\%</m>-confidence
    interval is
    <me>100.432 \pm .011.</me>
    The coworkers claimed true value is <m>100.413</m> is outside of the
    confidence interval. Supposing the coworker's data is correct, we
    assume a Gauss measurement box with average <m>100.413</m> and
    SD of <m>.038</m>. The SE for the sample average
    is <m>.038/\sqrt{50}\approx .0054</m>
    The observed sample average has a <m>z</m>-value of
    <me>z=\frac{100.432-100.413}{.0054}\approx 3.54.</me>
    The chance of obtaining this observed sample average or higher (in
    50 measurements) is less than <m>0.02\%\approx \frac{1}{5000}</m>. Null hypothesis: the
    coworker's values are correct; the observed data is due to chance
    variation. The observed level of significance
    is <m>P=.02\%</m>. The difference is highly significant. We reject
    the null hypothesis.
  </p>

  <p><alert>Problem 2.</alert> Your <m>95\%</m>-confidence interval is
    <md>
      <mrow>\frac{110}{250} \pm 2\frac{\sqrt{110/250 \cdot
	140/250}}{\sqrt{250}}</mrow>
      <mrow>44\% \pm 6.28\%.</mrow>
    </md>
    The probability that a fair wheel lands red is <m>18/38 \approx
    47.37\%</m>. This is within the confidence interval. Supposing the
    coworkers claim is correct, we assume a 0-1 box with 18 1's and 20
    0's. The SE for the sum is <m>\sqrt{18/38\cdot
    20/38}\sqrt{250}\approx 7.89</m>.
    The chance that 250 spins would have 110 or more reds is the area to
    the left of 110.5 (using the correction for
    continuity). The <m>z</m>-value is
    <m>z=\frac{110.5-118.42}{7.89}\approx -1.0</m>, so the probability
    is <m>P\approx 16\%</m> (you get <m>P\approx 14\%</m> if you work in
    percent and do not use the continuity correction). Null hypothesis: the
    coworker's claims of fairness are correct; the observed data is due to chance
    variation. The observed level of significance
    is <m>P=16\%</m>. The difference is not significant. We do not
    reject the null hypothesis.
