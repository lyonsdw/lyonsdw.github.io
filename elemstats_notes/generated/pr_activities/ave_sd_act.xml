  <title>Intuition for Average and SD</title>

  <p>A <alert>data list</alert> is a sequence of numbers, called
    the <alert>entries</alert> in the list. For example, the sequence <m>X=1,2,2,7</m> is a data list with four
    entries. The sum of a list is the total of all the entries.
    The average of a list is the
    sum of the list divided by the number of entries. For a given number <m>a</m>,
    the <alert>deviations</alert> of a list <m>X</m> from <m>a</m> is
    the list <m>X</m>
    with <m>a</m>
    subtracted from each value in X. We write the sum, average, and
    deviations like this for <m>X=1,2,2,7</m>.
    <md>
      <mrow>\SUM(X)\amp  = 1+2+2+7=12</mrow>
      <mrow>\AVE(X) \amp =12/4 = 3 </mrow>
      <mrow>(\text{deviations of } X \text{ from } 2) \amp =
	-1,0,0,5 </mrow>
      <mrow>(\text{deviations of } X \text{ from } 3) \amp = -2,-1,-1,4 </mrow>      
    </md>    
  </p>

  <p>Here are two useful concepts to visualize a data list <m>X</m>.
    <ul>
      <li>A <alert>box model</alert> for <m>X</m> is a box that
      contains tickets with the entries of the list printed on the
	tickets. We imagine a lottery game, taking <alert>random draws</alert> <alert>with
      replacement</alert> from the box. This means that every ticket in the
	box has the same chance to be selected on every draw.
      </li>
      <li>
	A <alert>dot plot</alert> for <m>X</m>
	is a number line with dots placed at locations given by the
	entries in the list. We imagine that the
	number line is a see-saw and that the dots are small, identical
	weights stuck to the see-saw. Physics says that the see-saw is
	balanced on a fulcrum at the point <m>a</m>
	if the sum of the deviations of <m>X</m>
	from <m>a</m> is zero.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <alert>Problems:</alert>
    Let <m>X</m>
    be the data list <m>X=1,2,2,7</m>, and suppose we take <m>100</m>
    random draws with replacement from the box model for <m>X</m>.
    <ol>
      <li>Among the <m>100</m>
	random draws, what is the expected number
	of <m>1</m>’s that will be drawn? The expected number
	of <m>2</m>’s? The expected
	number of <m>7</m>’s?</li>
      <li>What is the expected sum total of all <m>100</m>
	draws?</li>
      <li>Suppose you win the amount of money, in dollars, that is equal
	to the sum total of the <m>100</m> random draws. What is the
	amount of your per-game winning? (Your per-game winning is the
	amount <m>A</m>, such that if you won the amount <m>A</m>
	<m>100</m> times in a
	row, would give you the same total as the <m>100</m> 
	draws from the box model for <m>X</m>?)</li>
      <li>Does the see-saw for the dot plot of <m>X</m> balance at the
	point <m>2</m>? At the point <m>4</m>? At the point <m>3</m>?
      </li>
      <li>Suppose that, for every one of the <m>100</m> draws, you have
      to guess a number before the draw (your guess does not have to be
	one of the values in the list <m>X</m>). After the number is
	drawn, you have to pay the <em>square</em> of the amount by
	which your guess is off, in dollars. For example, if you
	guess <m>4.5</m> and then a <m>2</m> is drawn, you have to
      pay <m>2.5^2= \$6.25</m>. It is not obvious, but it turns out that
      the best strategy for making your total cost as low as possible is
	to guess the average value of <m>X</m> every time. Try it out!
	Play the game <m>10</m> times, say, guessing <m>2</m> every
	time, and keep track of the total cost. Play another <m>10</m>
	times, guessing however you like. Then play <m>10</m> times,
	guessing the average of <m>X</m> every time. Now compare the
      total costs. Which one is best?
