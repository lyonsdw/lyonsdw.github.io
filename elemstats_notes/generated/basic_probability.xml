  <title>Probability terminology (Ch 13<ndash/>15)</title>

  <p>[Note: The symbols given in this section appear in Friedman's text in a
note on p.227 at the end of Exercise Set B.]
</p>

  <p>In a box model, an <term>outcome</term>
    is a sequence of tickets obtained by random
draws, either with or without replacement. For example, here are the 12
possible outcomes for 2 draws, without replacement, from the box
  <m>\{A,K,Q,J\}</m>. (This is a box model for <q>two cards are dealt from a 4-card
    deck containing an ace, a king, a queen, and a jack</q>.)
  <me> \text{set of all outcomes} = \{AK,AQ,AJ,KA,KQ,KJ,QA,QK,QJ,JA,JK,JQ\}</me>
  In this notation, <m>AK</m> means the ace is drawn first, and the king
  second, while <m>KA</m> means the king is first and the ace is second.
</p>

<p>
  An <term>event</term>
  is a set of outcomes. For example, the events <q>get a queen</q>
   and
  <q>get a king on the first draw</q>
   are 
<md>
  <mrow>\text{"get a queen"} \amp = \{QA,QK,QJ,AQ,KQ,JQ\}</mrow>
  <mrow>\text{"get a king on draw 1"} \amp = \{KA,KQ,KJ\}.</mrow>
</md>
Another example is the event <q>get the hand ace-king</q>. In
a <q>hand</q>, it does
not matter what order the cards are dealt in, so we have
<me>  \text{"get the hand ace-king"} = \{AK,KA\}.</me>
To say that two events <m>E</m>
and <m>F</m>
<q>both happen</q>
 can be rephrased <m>\text{"}E \AND F\text{"}</m>. To say that <q>at least one of the events <m>E,F</m>
  happens</q>
 can be
rephrased <m>\text{"}E \OR F\text{"}</m>. For example, for the events
<md>
  <mrow>  E = \text{"get an ace"} = \{AK,AQ,AJ,KA,QA,JA\}</mrow>
  <mrow>  F = \text{"get a king"} = \{KA,KQ,KJ,AK,QK,JK\}</mrow>
</md>
we have the following.
<md>
  <mrow>  E \AND F \amp = \text{"get a hand with an ace and a king"} = \{AK,KA\}</mrow>
  <mrow>E \OR F \amp = \text{"get a hand with an ace or a king (or
    both)"}</mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = \{AK,AQ,AJ,KA,QA,JA,KQ,KJ,QK,JK\}</mrow>
</md>
[Comment for students who know about intersection and union of sets: the
event <m>\text{"}E \AND F\text{"}</m> is the same thing as the intersection of the sets <m>E,F</m>,
and the event <m>\text{"}E \OR F\text{"}</m> is the same thing as the union of the sets <m>E,F</m>.]
</p>

<p>We will use the correct terms <q>outcome</q>
  and <q>event</q>
   instead of the vague
  term <q>thing</q>
   used in the text in Ch 13.
</p>

<p>We will write <m>P(E)</m>
  to denote the probability for an event <m>E</m>. For
  example, in the game of 2 draws, with replacement, from the box
  <m>\{A,K,Q,J\}</m>,
  the probability of the single outcome <m>AK</m>
  is
<me>
  P(AK) = 1/12 \approx 8.3\%
</me>
because there are 12 equally likely outcomes for the 2 draws. The
probability for getting the hand ace-king is
<me>
  P(\text{get the hand ace-king}) = 2/12 \approx 16.7\%
</me>
because there are 2 equally likely outcomes in the event <q>get the hand
  ace-king</q>, and there are 12 equally likely outcomes in all for the 2
draws. The probability of getting a queen is
<me>
  P(\text{get a queen}) = 6/12 = 50\%
</me>
because there are 6 equally likely outcomes in the event <q>get a
  queen</q>. The
probability of getting king on the first draw is
<me>
  P(\text{get a king on draw 1}) = 3/12 = 25\%
</me>
because there are 3 equally likely outcomes in the event <q>get a king
  on draw 1</q>.
</p>

<p>The textbook does not give a definition of the term conditional
probability; instead, they explain by example in Ch 13 Sec. 2
  (p.226). Here is the definition: The <term>conditional
    probability</term>
  of event <m>E</m>
  given that event <m>F</m>
  has happened, denoted <m>P(E|F)</m>, is
<men xml:id="condprobdefbasic">
   P(E|F) = \frac{P(E \AND F)}{P(F)}
</men>
where the event <q><m>E \AND F</m></q>
 is the set of all outcomes that belong to both
events <m>E</m> and <m>F</m>. For example, in 2 draws with replacement from the box
<m>\{A,K,Q,J\}</m>, we have
<me>
  P(\text{get a queen | get a king on draw 1}) = 1/3 \approx 33.3\%
</me>
because there is 1 outcome, namely <m>KQ</m>, that has a <m>Q</m>,
among the 3 outcomes that have <m>K</m> on draw 1. We also have
<me>
  P(\text{get a king on draw 1 | get a queen}) = 1/6 \approx 16.7\%
</me>
because there is 1 outcome, namely <m>KQ</m>, for which draw 1 is a <m>K</m>, among
the 6 outcomes that have a <m>Q</m>.
</p>

<p>The definitions of independent and dependent events (box on p.230)
  should be replaced by the following: <q>Two events <m>E,F</m>
  are <term>independent</term>
  if
  <m>P(F|E) = P(F)</m>. Otherwise, the events <m>E,F</m>
  are <term>dependent</term>.</q>
   Or in words,
  <q>Two events <m>E,F</m>
  are independent if the probability of <m>F</m>
  given that <m>E</m>
  has
  happened is equal to the probability of <m>F</m>. Otherwise, the
  events <m>E,F</m>
    are dependent.</q>

<exercises>
  <introduction>
    <p>Problems 1 and 2 are about the following situation: A box contains seven tickets, labeled <m>a,b,c,d,e,f,g</m>. In Game 1,
    tickets are drawn from the box with replacement. In Game 2, tickets
    are drawn without replacement. On any given draw, every ticket
    remaining in the box is equally likely to be selected on the next
      draw.
      Consider the following events.
      <md>
	<mrow>E \amp= \text{get the ticket } a \text{ on draw 1}
	</mrow>
	<mrow>F \amp= \text{get the ticket } b \text{ on draw 2}
	</mrow>	
	<mrow>G \amp= \text{get two vowels in the first two draws}

	<mrow>H \amp= \text{get exactly two vowels in the first seven draws}
