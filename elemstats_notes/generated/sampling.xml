  <title>Sampling Vocabulary and Formulas</title>
  
  <p>
    A sequence of random draws from a box model is
    called a <term>sample</term><idx><h>sample</h>
    </idx>
    from the box. A sequence of random draws taken without
    replacement is called a <term>simple random
      sample</term><idx><h>simple random
	sample</h></idx>. The <term>sample sum</term><idx><h>sample sum</h></idx>
    is the sum
    of the draws. The <term>sample average</term><idx><h>sample average</h>
    </idx>
    is the average of the draws. For a box
whose tickets are labeled with 0's and 1's, the percentage of 1's drawn
    in a sample is called the <term>sample
      percentage of 1's</term><idx><h>sample percentage of 1's</h>
    </idx>.
</p>

  <example xml:id="samplingeg1">
<p>      Box contents:
  <me>1,2,3</me>

  All possible samples of size 2, with replacement:
  <me>    (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)</me>

  All possible sample sums:
  <me>  2,3,4,3,4,5,4,5,6</me>

  All possible sample averages:
  <me>    1,1.5,2,1.5,2,2.5,2,2.5,3</me>
</p>
  </example>

<p>  The sample sum, the sample average, and the sample percentage of 1's are
  examples
  of <term>statistics</term>. A <term>statistic</term><idx><h>statistic</h>
  </idx>
  is any number that is computed from
a sample. Another important statistic is the sample SD (the SD of the
list of draws). By contrast, any number that can be computed from the
  numbers in the box is called a <term>parameter</term><idx><h>parameter</h></idx>. For example, the average and
the SD of the numbers in the box are parameters. Sampling theory is the
art of exploiting the relationships between parameters and statistics to
do these two kinds of tasks.

  <ul>  <li><term>Prediction:</term><idx><h>prediction</h>
      </idx>
      If you know what is in a given box, calculate the probability
    that a given statistic will fall in a given range of values.</li>

    <li>  <term>Inference:</term><idx><h>inference</h>
      </idx>
      If you do not know all the details of the contents of a
  box, but you have access to one or more samples from the box, make
  educated guesses about the parameters of the box.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Sampling theory relies on the key formulas
  <xref ref="expectedsumformula"/> and <xref ref="sesumformula"/> below that
express the fundamental relationships between the contents of a box
model and samples coming out of the box. First we have to introduce the
quantities involved. The average of the list of all possible sample sums
  is called the <term>expected sum</term><idx><h>expected sum (of sample
      draws)</h></idx> of the sample draws, which we will denote by
  <q>expected(sum)</q><notation><usage><m>\text{expected(sum)}</m>
    </usage><description>expected
      sum of sample draws</description>
  </notation>. The
  SD of the list of all sample sums is called the <term>standard error
    (SE) for the
    sum</term><idx><h>standard error (SE) for the sum (of sample
      draws)</h></idx> of the sample draws, which we
  will denote by
  <q>SE(sum)</q><notation><usage><m>\text{SE(sum)}</m>
    </usage><description>standard
  error for the sum of sample draws</description>
  </notation>. Similarly, the average of the list of all
  sample averages is called the <term>expected
    average</term><idx><h>expected average (of sample draws)</h>
  </idx> of the sample draws (denoted <q>expected(ave)</q><notation><usage><m>\text{expected(average)}</m>
    </usage><description>expected
  average of sample draws</description></notation>)
and the SD of the list of all sample averages is called the <term>SE for the
    average</term><idx><h>standard error (SE) for the average (of sample
  draws)</h> </idx> of the sample draws (denoted
  <q>SE(ave)</q><notation><usage><m>\text{SE(ave)}</m>
    </usage><description>standard
  error for the average of sample draws</description>
  </notation>). For a box containing only 0's and 1's, the
average of all the sample percentages of 1's is called the <term>expected
    percentage of 1's</term><idx><h>expected percentage of 1's (of
      sample draws)</h></idx>
  (denoted
  <q>expected(%1's)</q><notation><usage><m>\text{expected(%1's)}</m>
    </usage><description>expected
      percentage of 1's for sample draws</description></notation>) and the SD of the list of
  all sample percentages of 1's is called the <term>SE for the
    percentage of 1's</term><idx><h>standard error (SE) for the percentage
      of 1's (of sample draws)</h></idx>
  (denoted
  <q>SE(%1s)</q><notation><usage><m>\text{SE(%1's)}</m>
    </usage><description>standard
      error for the percentage of 1's (of sample draws)</description></notation>).
</p>

<example>For <xref ref="samplingeg1"/>, we have the following.

  <md>  <mrow>\text{expected(sum) } \amp = (2+3+3+4+4+4+5+5+6)/9 = 4</mrow>
    <mrow>  \text{SE(sum) } \amp = \sqrt{ (-2)^2 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(0^2) + 2(1)^2 + 2^2)/9}
          \approx 1.15</mrow>
    <mrow>\text{expected(average) } = 2</mrow>
    <mrow>\text{SE(average) } \approx 0.58</mrow>
  </md>
</example>

<p>For samples with replacement, we have the following
  formulas. Equation <xref ref="sesumformula"/> is called
  the <term>Square Root Law</term><idx><h>Square Root Law</h></idx>.

<mdn>
  <mrow xml:id="expectedsumformula">\text{ expected(sum) }\amp = (\text{average of the box}) \cdot (\text{number of draws})</mrow>
  <mrow number="no">\text{expected(ave) } \amp  = \text{average of the box}</mrow>
  <mrow number="no">\text{expected(%1's) }\amp = \text{percent 1's in the box}</mrow>
</mdn>

<mdn>
  <mrow xml:id="sesumformula">\text{ SE(sum) } \amp  = (\text{SD of the box}) \sqrt{\text{number of draws}}</mrow>
  <mrow number="no">\text{SE(ave) }\amp =
  \frac{\text{SE(sum)}}{{\text{number of draws}}} = \frac{\text{SD of
  the box}}{\sqrt{\text{number of draws}}} </mrow>
  <mrow number="no">\text{SE(%1's) }\amp =
  \frac{\text{SE(sum)}}{{\text{number of draws}}} \cdot 100\% =
  \frac{\text{SD of the box}}{\sqrt{\text{number of draws}}} \cdot 100\%</mrow>
</mdn>
For samples without replacement, there is no change in formula <xref ref="expectedsumformula"/>, but
each of the equations in <xref ref="sesumformula"/> is replaced by

<men xml:id="sewithcorrfact"> \text{SE(without replacement) }= \text{SE(with replacement) } \cdot (\text{correction factor})</men>

where the <term>correction factor</term><idx><h>correction factor</h>
</idx>
is given by the following.
<men>  \text{correction factor } = \sqrt{ \frac{N - n}{N - 1} },</men>
where
<md>
  <mrow>N \amp = \text{the number of tickets in the box}</mrow>
  <mrow>n \amp = \text{the number of draws in the sample}.</mrow>
</md>
</p>

<p>
  The reason we say that <xref ref="expectedsumformula"/> and
<xref ref="sesumformula"/> are just two equations and not six is because
of the simple relationships between sum, average, and percentage of
1's. The average of a list of numbers is the sum of that list of numbers
divided by the number of items in the list; the percentage of 1's (in a
list of 0's and 1's) is the average of that same list of 0's and 1's
times 100%. Applying these simple relationships (summarized in equation
<xref ref="avesumpctrelation"/>, below) to the first of the three
equations in each of <xref ref="expectedsumformula"/> and <xref ref="sesumformula"/>
produces the rest of the equations in <xref ref="expectedsumformula"/> and <xref ref="sesumformula"/>.

<mdn>
  <mrow xml:id="avesumpctrelation">\text{average(list) }\amp = \frac{\text{sum(list)}}{\text{#items in the list}}</mrow>
  <mrow number="no">\text{percent 1's in a list of 0's and 1's }\amp = (\text{average of the list}) \cdot 100\%</mrow>
</mdn>
</p>

<p>Many sampling problems use a box model with only two different values on
  the tickets contained in the box. In this case, it is useful to have
  the following <q>short-cut</q>
   SD formula.
</p>

<subsection><title>The Central Limit Theorem</title>
<p>
  Sampling theory derives its power from a fact called the <term>Central
    Limit Theorem</term><idx><h>Central Limit Theorem</h></idx>. The
    Central Limit Theorem says that, no matter what numbers are in a box
    model, the histogram of all possible (standardized) sample sums
    (which is the same as the standardized sample average or the
    standardized sample percentage of 1's) is close to the standard
    normal distribution, as long as the number of draws is sufficiently
    large. [Our textbook is vague about how large is <q>sufficiently
    large</q>. For a box with a uniform distribution (that is, a histogram
    for which all the blocks are close to even in height), 25 draws or
    more is sufficiently large. For a box that is very uneven (that is,
    a histogram with blocks of very different heights), sufficiently
    large might be 100 or more draws.]

  <title>Basic prediction problem</title>
<p>Armed with the facts and formulas above, here is the skeleton of the basic
prediction problem.

  <ul> <li> Given: a description of a chance process</li>
<li>  Question: find the probability that a sample (with a sufficiently
            large number of draws) from a box model for the chance
            process produces a sum or average in a given range
</li>
  </ul>
The procedure to solve the problem has these steps:

<ul><li>Construct the box model that matches the question. How many
        tickets are in the box? What numbers are on the tickets? How
        many draws?  Are the draws taken with or without replacement? Is
    the question about the sum or the average of the draws?</li>

  <li><p>Perform calculations.  
    <ul>
      <li>ave(box)</li>
      <li>SD(box)</li>
      <li>expected(sum,ave,%1's) (using <xref ref="expectedsumformula"/>)</li>
      <li>SE(sum,ave,%1's) (using <xref ref="sesumformula"/> and also
      <xref ref="sewithcorrfact"/> if draws are without replacement)</li>
    </ul></p>
</li>
  
<li>Sketch a normal curve (justified by the Central Limit Theorem)
        and shade an area that answers the question. The center of the
        horizontal axis is expected(sum,ave,%1's)) (depending on
  the question). Find the <m>z</m>
  values needed for your shaded area.
<me>      
z =  \frac{\text{(sum,ave,%1's in the question)} - (\text{expected(sum,ave,%1's)})}{\text{SE(sum,ave,%1's)}}
</me>
</li>
<li>Finally, use the normal distribution table to find the area that
answers the given question.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<subsection>
  <title>Basic Inference Problem</title>

<p>The basic inferential statistics problem in our text goes like this: you
are given information about a sample from a box with unknown
contents. You are asked to estimate the average of the box, and to make
an educated statement about how far off that estimate might be from the
actual value.
</p>

<p>Let's write ave(observed) and SD(observed) to denote the average and SD
of the list of numbers in the given sample. By virtue of Equation <xref ref="expectedsumformula"/>, it is
intuitively reasonable to use ave(observed) to estimate ave(box). It is
not so clear, but it turns out to be okay for large enough samples, to
use SD(observed) to estimate SD(box). By <xref ref="sesumformula"/>, it makes sense that our actual
ave(observed) will be off from the ave(box) by SE(ave), which we can
estimate by
  <men xml:id="bootstrap"> \text{SE(ave) } \approx
    \frac{\text{SD(observed)}}{\sqrt{\text{number of draws}}} \;\;\text{(estimated)}</men>
(times the correction factor, if sampling without replacement). Equation
  <xref ref="bootstrap"/> is called the <term>bootstrap
    estimate</term><idx><h>bootstrap estimate</h></idx> for the SE of
    the sample average.
</p>

<p>It makes intuitive sense to report our estimate of ave(box) as follows.
  <me>  \text{ave(observed)} \pm \text{(estimated SE(ave))}</me>
  For a positive number <m>z</m>, let's write Area(<m>z</m>) to denote the area under
  the normal curve in the range <m>-z</m>
  to <m>+z</m>. The interval 
  <men xml:id="confinterval"> \text{ave(observed)} \pm z\cdot \text{(estimated SE(ave))}</men>
  is called an <term>Area(<m>z</m>) confidence interval for
    ave(box)</term><idx><h>confidence interval</h></idx>. For example, a
95% confidence interval for the average of the box is the observed
sample average plus or minus 2 times the estimated SE for the sample
average. 
</p>

<p>By virtue of the Central Limit Theorem, we can make a precise
probability statement about the interval <xref ref="confinterval"/>. We can say that
  approximately Area(<m>z</m>) (time 100 percent) of all Area(<m>z</m>) confidence intervals
(imagine many samples of the given sample size) will contain the average
of the box. For example, approximately 95% of all 95% confidence
intervals (calculated from many samples) will contain the box average.
