<h1>The Hopf Fibration</h1>

<h2>Tiered prerequisites</h2>

<!--<h3>0. (no prerequisites) Hopf fibration in layman's terms</h3>-->

<ol>

<li>The Hopf fibration "in layman's terms" has no prerequisites.  

<li>The Hopf fibration "via quaternions" is designed to be the most
accessible of the mathematical definitions.  The prerequisites are
undergraduate courses in multivariate calculus and linear algebra.
Multivariate calculus itself is not used, however.  What is needed from
this course is experience with the concept of multivariate functions and
euclidean spaces of various dimensions.

<li>The Hopf fibration "via projective space" requires some comfort with
spaces of equivalence classes.  Conceptually, projective space presents the
same level of difficulty to the beginner as do quotients of vector spaces
and the set of integers modulo <i>n</i>.

<li>The Hopf fibration "via group action" requires some experience with
abstract algebra.  This experience may come from a formal course or less
formal independent study.
