<h1>The Hopf Fibration</h1>

<!--The Hopf fibration is a map <i>h:S<sup>3</sup> -> S<sup>2</sup></i>-->

The Hopf fibration, named after Heinz Hopf who studied it in a 1931 paper,
has become an important object in mathematics and physics.  Unfortunately,
it is little known in the undergraduate curriculum.  The thesis of this web
tutorial is that the Hopf fibration <b><i>can</i></b> be accessible
to undergraduate mathematics and physics majors.  We have structured our
presentation to facilitate individualized study.

<h3>Four approaches to the Hopf fibration</h3>

The following links present, in order of increasing <a
href="prereq.html">prerequisites</a>, the definition and basic properties
of the Hopf fibration.
