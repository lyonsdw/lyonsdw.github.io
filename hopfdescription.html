<h2>
			 Fibers of the Hopf map
</h2>

The Hopf fibration is a map <i>h</i> from the 3-sphere <i>S</i><sup>3</sup> to the to the 2-sphere
<i>S</i><sup>2</sup>.  The preimage <i>h</i><sup>-1</sup>(<i>p</i>) of each point
<i>p</i> in <i>S</i><sup>2</sup> is a circle in <i>S</i><sup>3</sup>.
These circles are called fibers of the Hopf map.

<p>

We can see these circles in 3-space via stereographic projection.  The
image you see in the background of this web page is a picture of
stereographically projected fibers corresponding to a circular path of base
points on <i>S</i><sup>2</sup>.  Each fiber is linked with every other
fiber.  Since the Hopf map is surjective, stereographic projections of the
set of all fibers fill all of 3-space with disjoint, linked circles (and
one straight line, which is the fiber which passes through the point of
projection).

This image is the product of an animated 3D imaging project by David
Lyons (Mathematics), Paul Hemler (Computer Science) and Keeley Chorn
(student) of Wake Forest University.

The paper referenced below is an account of geometric and algebraic
topics surrounding the Hopf fibration for an undergraduate audience.  I
will send hard copies on request.
