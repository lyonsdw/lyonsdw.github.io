<p>

My current research is in quantum information
science--an interdisciplinary area involving mathematics, physics, 
computer science, and engineering.  

<p>

My thesis work, under the direction of Shrawan Kumar, was in algebraic
topology of Lie Groups.

<p>

My pedagogical scholarship is driven by a longstanding interest in
the use of geometry and visualization for teaching mathematical
concepts.

<p>

I am a regular participant and webmaster for the Tetrahedral
Geometry-Topology Seminar, of which Lebanon Valley College is a joint
sponsor with Millersville University, Elizabethtown College, and
Franklin and Marshall College.  I am co-Principal Investigator for our Mathematical
Physics Research Group here at LVC.
