			Fedora 7 on Dell desktop
			     Install Notes

		       David Lyons lyons@lvc.edu

[Note 8/19/2008: have installed fresh ubuntu 8.04 on this machine]

6/13/2007

Fresh install from dvd.

Chose lots of packages.

disable firewall and disable SELinux
  this has caused trouble in the past with ssh, network backups, other stuff?

migrated /home/ copy from backup
  moved ~/ dot config files to /home/lyons_old_dotfiles to keep them
  from overwriting the new fedora 7 defaults
  kept these
   .emacs
   .evolution
   .fvwm2rc
   .gnupg
   .bashrc
   downloads
   tmp
   .scripts
   .gaim

.bashrc, added my personal configurations to the default file
  aliases
  paths
  texinputs

printing
  worked first time, no trouble with papersize like ubuntu

firefox personalization

  installed google toolbar, set gmail as default mail client
  downloads to ~/downloads
  home page 

fvwm
  yum install fvwm
  copy over .X* files
  worked first time, blue background is black for some reason
    might try living with gnome for a while
  comment 6/26: have been living without fvwm, and I haven't missed it.
  gnome is much faster and less buggy than it used to be.  the
  convenience of a desktop designed to function with the operating
  system outweighs the little annoyances and I'm going to keep using
  gnome. 

mp3 support
  had to do this to get wrek to play in rhythmbox
  instructions from
  http://linux-poison.blogspot.com/2007/06/install-mp3-support-in-fedora-7.html 

   Open a terminal and become root, then run this command:
wget http://rpm.livna.org/fedora/7/i386/livna-release-7-2.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh livna-release-7-2.noarch.rpm

yum -y install gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-ugly xine-lib-extras-nonfree

more things to install (they weren't there)
  xfig         used yum install
  texmaker
  xdvi         used add/remove under Applications menu
  xpdf         yum install xpdf


java under firefox  doesn't work yet 6/13
    install java jre
    # mkdir /usr/java
    put the self extracting file  jre-6u1-linux-i586.bin in /usr/java
    execute the self extracting file (make it exectuable if necessary)
    # ./ jre-6u1-linux-i586.bin
    # ln -s /usr/java/jre1.6.0_01/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so
    /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libjavaplugin_oji.so  

   6/14 added this, following directions on
   http://www.gagme.com/greg/linux/f7-tips.php#java
    # /usr/sbin/alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java
      /usr/java/jre1.6.0_01/bin/java 1601
   still doesn't work
   java under firefox under fedora seems to be getting worse!!!

    bafooey!  it just doesn't work.  I've messed with redoing the links,
    moved jre from /usr/lib to /usr/java and redone all the links, but
    it still doesn't work.  when you try to load a page with a java
    applet, it thinks it has the jre plugin (it doesn't pop up the
    missing plugin dialog) but it just sits there blank.  ugh!!  also
    tried deleting and reinstalling jre from the self extracting file.
    still no luck.

    /etc/alternatives
     ln -s /usr/java/jre1.6.0_01/bin/java java

   6/15 tried again, fresh install of jre using 
     jre-6u1-linux-i586-rpm.bin
   still does not work

6/14/2007 strange reboot problem

  shut down computer at the end of the afternoon yesterday because of
  thunderstorms.  rebooted this morning.  gets up to the point where the
  login screen should come up, but screen goes black and the system
  hangs for several minutes (5 or so?).  it finally came up.  don't know
  what causes this.

  very weird.  when it hangs, I can ssh into s3 from my laptop, and can
  even run a remote X session.  

  aha, just ran system-config-services (System -> Administration ->
  Services) and unchecked firstboot (also unchecked sendmail).  let's
  see if this fixes the problem.  no it does not fix it.  what the heck?

  even worse, the blackout happened when the screen went to
  screensaver. what seems to work a little both on bootup and after
  screensaver is to turn the monitor off and on again.  but that is not
  really a solution.  this needs to be solved.

6/19 more on this video problem
  did this as superuser
  System > Administration > Display
    Hardware tab
     video card Configure button
      changed to intel Experimental modesetting driver etc etc
   rebooted and it works this time
   will see if it keeps working

6/20 x server problem maybe solved?
  two days of restarting X and rebooted a couple of times, seems to
  work ok.  

6/26 comment: yes, x xerver seems to run fine now, no freeze ups

arkeia
  install and configure
  done with Ken's help

7/23 installed acroread from adobe's web site, had strange problem, easy fix

http://javier.rodriguez.org.mx/index.php/2007/06/01/fix-adobe-acrobat-readers-expr-syntax-error-message/

8/6 found out how to get rid of annoying desktop icons.  Install
gconf-editor using Applications >> Add/Remove Software.  Run
gconf-editor.  Go to apps >> nautilus >> desktop.  Uncheck the
checkboxes for the icons.

8/9/2007 install mathematica
  this turned out to be the usual pain in the butt.  the install failed,
  with an error message about a missing password file.  but the real
  problem turned out to be that mathematica wanted an outdated c++
  library, libstdc++.so.5.  so I installed that with yum, then stuff
  worked. sheesh.

  along the way I found out that the cdrom is /dev/scd0

8/20/2007
fix java under firefox
  still not working 8/9/2007
  somehow this started working on 8/20.  as far as I know, I did nothing
  to make it work.  weird.
