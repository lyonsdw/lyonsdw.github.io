New installation Fedora Core 5

Dell desktop machine

used 5 cd's burned by Oliver, checked and used once successfully

installed all packages

added
  xmms       % yum install xmms
  sylpheed   % yum install sylpheed
  fvwm       tarball from fvwm.org
  vm         get tarball, put in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/vm-7.19
              make all
              had to turn off smtp mail sending lines in .vm
                7/24 and now I realize this is a terrible problem
                     smtp is needed for mail to be received by some  servers
             maybe fixed? got file netrc.el off web and put it in
              /usr/share/emacs/21.4/lisp/net/

  arkeia     Ken had to mess with it
              had to set the hostname in /etc/sysconfig/network
