RedHat 9.0

Computer purchased from EmperorLinux, came with broadcom ethernet card,
pcmcia modem, set up with customized emplinux kernel, RedHat 8 version.
Printing did not work via printtool or cups.  There were other problems and
frustrations.

Performed fresh install of RedHat 9.0, chose "workstation" install.  Had to
go back, use package manager (Start menu > System Settings > Add/Remove
applications) to install tex, xfig, kernel source tree, etc, etc.  Next
time just install all packages to save this trouble.

Observation/Disappointment with RedHat/Gnome: RedHat 9 seems to have
invested heavily in monolithic, ponderous applications (OpenOffice,
Evolution) to solve all user needs.  In the process, they seem to be racing
as hard as they can to look like MSjunk.  What happened?  Where are all the
nifty, fast, useful little apps that used to come on RedHat, like gnomecal?
Why isn't the mail and mime reading capability of emacs built as default?
I do not like this trend.  

Another beef: what happened to linuxconf?  A unified admin tool was great
idea.  Now they've spread all the admin tasks over little gnome apps all
over the place.  If you are not running gnome, admin is trickier now.

    Configuration and Setup
================================

Display configuration: using systems settings Display tool
  Display tab:

  G40 XGA with i830M
  resolution 1024 x 768
  millions of colors

  Advanced tab:

  horiz refresh rates 30.0-64.0
  vert refresh rates  50.0-100.0
  DPI unknown

  Video Card Type i830M
  Memory size     16 megabytes
  Driver i810
    
ethernet connectivity
  broadcom card
   * downloaded linux driver from www.broadcom.com
   * transferred to new machine on a floppy
   * followed instructions in README and DISTRIB notes to install
     had to first install "kernel source tree" by installing kernel
     packages, used package manager tool "Add/Remove applications" under
     system settings on start menu

  old linksys card autodetected, worked first try

  ran RedHat up2date 7/22/2003, installed new kernel, this was incompatible
  with card driver, so had to rm broadcom files (keep the tar file) and
  reinstall

  9/11/2003 up2date gave me yet another new kernel a few weeks back.
  this killed the ethernet card again, and this time I could not get it
  to build.  So I am not yet running that new kernel.

gramps

  got rpm gramps-0.9.2-1.i386.rpm from gramps home page
   needed gnome-python2-1.99.14-6.i386.rpm
    which needed gnome-python2-gconf-1.99.14-6.i386.rpm
    got these from rpmfind.net
  it works!

printers
  printtool does not seem to work any more
  use CUPS or redhat-config-printer 
    access CUPS via web browser, URL is localhost:631
  can view jobs with gnome-print-manager

java
 7/22/2003 downloaded and installed j2sdk 1.4.2 from www.javasoft.com
  used the rpm

mozilla and java

 instruction from mozilla release notes:
   Linux Put a symlink to
   /usr/java/jre<version>/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so in your
   plugins/ directory. (Note copying the file instead of making the symlink
   will cause Java to crash.)

 this did NOT work for mozilla 1.2.1 that came with RedHat 9. 

 downloaded and installed mozilla 1.4 (bunch of rpms from mozilla site),
 restarted, java worked right away with no symlinks or anything

enscript
  downloaded an rpm for RedHat 9 from rpmfind.com and installed it
  this did not come on the RedHat install for some reason
    maybe this can be replaced by a2ps in the future?

gFTP crashes
  used gFTP to migrate lots of files from old computer to new computer.
  gFTP seems to crash a lot, but it seems to be just after it finishes a
  transfer 

w3m
  got the rpms from rpmfind.net and installed them
    w3m-0.3.2.2-5.i386.rpm     was already installed
    emacs-w3m-1.3.4 (tar.gz)   ./configure, make, make install
    w3m-el-1.3.3-4.src.rpm     rpm -Uvh

mail     metamail missing?  rmime doesn't work?
  emacs
   hmmmm,  experimentation 7/23
   rmime seems to work, had to copy it to /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp
   now we are missing mimencode
    aha!  mimencode is provided by metamail
    got an rpm for metamail for RedHat 7.x, it neede sharutils, so
    installed
       sharutils-4.2.1-14.i386.rpm
       metamail-2.7-28.i386.rpm
    and now emacs rmail seems to work

    one glitch, w3m complains about a missing icon

window manager
  redhat seems to no longer include fvwm 
  7/23 got fvwm from www.fvwm.org, rpm doesn't work, use source tar ball
   fvwm-2.4.16.tar
  had to diddle with .fvwm2rc file to get my pager to work
   looks great!  glad to have fvwm back!  looks like a strong support
   community
   spent some time putting the current gnome/redhat utilitites on my popup
   menu 

ical, gnomecal?
  ical seems to be dead.  old rpms and src files won't build.

  installed gnome-pim 7/24 (gnome-pim-1.4.9 from www.gnome.org), now
  gnomecal is here and works.  there was no documentation to indicate that
  I would get gnomecal by installing gnome-pim; I thought I was getting a
  bigger program, but I'm glad to have just gnomecal available.  Why does
  gnome/gnu/redhat make this hard to find?

  now I need to make --geometry work for gnomecal so fvwm InitFunction can
  put it in the right place on login

ghostview, gv

  neither of these was installed, had to go get the rpms from
  rpmfind.net
  redhat has something called ggv (gnome gv) which doesn't look as nice
  as gv

up2date

  this is great!  The little red button with the exclamation point on the
  gnome menu bar.  here is a way to run it not in gnome: first cd /usr/bin,
  then up2date.  you are prompted for root password, then it connects to
  RedHat servers, checks your machine for packages that need updating,
  downloads and installs for you.  so far all it costs is filling out an
  on-line questionnaire every few weeks.

  here is how to run this without gnome window manager:
   as root, cd /usr/bin, then up2date

  9/11/2003 up2date stopped working around the end of August 2003.
  RedHat sent out email that I need to get their new up2date client.
  Have tried to get it, but the web page download has not worked.  Will
  keep trying.

=====================
      TO DO
=====================

gnomecal geometry
  also test alarms--can it be run in the background and still alarm?

solve opengl library problems, again, to compile hopf software
