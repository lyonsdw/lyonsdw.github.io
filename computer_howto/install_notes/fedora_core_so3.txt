% yum update


dipslay resolution

gnome Applications pulldown menu
System Settings > Display

manually set to 1024x768 LCD

ODL's external hard drive
-------------------------

sound fixed! broken again! 1/14
-----
% gnome-volume-control
uncheck all "mute" checkboxes
run this as a regular user, it does not work if you are root
you may also need to mess with
% gnome-sound-* 
and other similar sounding things

for some reason sound has died and I can't get it going again

sound is really flaky!!! 1/17 won't keep working

firefox default mailer
----------------------
firefox's default mailer seems to be evolution (yuk!)

fix it like this:
close firefox
append the line
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.mailto","/usr/bin/thunderbird");
to the file prefs.js
in ~/.mozilla/firefox/dguffk1d.default

thunderbird attachment problem  mystery solved!
------------------------------
problem: thunderbird's attachment thingy won't read files whose names begin with dot

right click in the dialog box that browses for attachment files, you get a
box that says "Show Hidden Files", select it and you are ready to go

firefox "user agent" (browser identity) fixed? kludgey workaround!!
-------
(quicken turbo tax won't accept firefox)

http://www.chrispederick.com/work/firefox/useragentswitcher/download/
get user agent switcher
install (you have to click a button to allow the install)
then unter Tools menu in firefox you have a user agent switcher

in URL
about:config
you can see a bunch of settings,
the agent switcher put this entry
general.useragent.override  user set  string  (Mozilla/4.0 compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
now I see you can do this manually; go to the URL about:config
then right click in the browswer window for a popup menu to enter new item

(quicken turbo tax now accepts the identity, but hangs when you log in with
the message "Establishing secure connection")

for turbotax: use the useragent switcher to get into their site, then
switch back to "default" (firefox) when you log in; this seems to work

time
----
% system-config-time
click "enable network time protocol"
