Had trouble with fedora 7, installed but then hung on first boot.
Decided to try ubuntu, which we had tried on live cd.

Booted live cd, installed from there.

Used built-in Add/Remove and 
% sudo apt-get install packagename
to install a bunch of things, here are some
  emacs
  tetex
    7/24 discovered beamer package and related packages were missing,
    could not process talk slides I made with beamer in the spring.  I
    downloaded beamer, pgf and xcolor from sourceforge, I got the link
    to them from the beamer home page, installed it.  Run 
      % sudo texhash
    after putting the files in the tex directory tree.
  xfig
  gnuplot
  fvwm
  java

Things work well, interface is nice, speed is good.  Wireless at home
and at open connections is easy using network manager tool on toolbar.
So far cannot get wireless to work on LVC network.  Will continue to
try.

New firefox works fine with google spreadsheets, resolving old speed and
system bog down problem with fedora core 5.  Fedora 7 and its firefox
also work.

migrated personal directory stuff
  .emacs
  .fvwm2rc
  .gnupg
  .bashrc
  ~/a and subdirectories
  mkdir downloads
  mkdir tmp
  ~/.scripts
  ~/.gaim

printing
  problem!  there's some global setting to a4
  /etc/papersize ???
  can't get settings to letter size to take effect
 
  ok, finally got it, but I don't know why
  it might have to do with having edited /etc/papersize
    changed the single entry from a4 to letter
  then intalled some printers, letter size works

  emacs M-x print-buffer doesn't work well, margin problems?

  can't unset/reset the "tray 1" setting for psych_color printer, should
  be tray 2 but the setting won't take effect.  seems this printer
  config tool is buggy.

			 ======================
			 wireless configuration
			 ======================

wireless at LVC, success!

  1. install wpasupplicant
     sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant

  2. edit /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

network={
	ssid="wpublic"
	scan_ssid=1
	key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
	eap=PEAP
	identity="usernamehere"
	password="passwdhere"
}

  3. do this to connect, yee ha!
     sudo wpa_supplicant -iath0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dmadwifi -w
     sudo dhclient ath0

  4. don't click on network manager icon, it'll mess you up!

Comment: even though the connection is working, it cuts in and out a lot.  This
  is the way it has always been, I think.

  another useful command, a command line to scan for networks
    sudo iwlist scanning

  5. automate startup

wrote script ~/.scripts/lvcwirelessstart

#!/bin/sh

# 6/6/2007 works!
#  can we set up a clickable launcher?

sudo -b wpa_supplicant -iath0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dmadwifi -w
sudo -b dhclient ath0

		     =============================
		     end of wireless configuration
		     =============================

control startup programs on login

    * System -> Preferences -> Sessions
        Startup Programs Tab -> Add/Edit/Delete

    I unchecked firefox.  It was listed under "No Name".  Sinister?

disable the touchpad

  a. edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, find the section for synaptics, add the
  line that turns on option SHMConfig

Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Synaptics Touchpad"
	Driver	         "synaptics"
        Option          "SHMConfig"             "on"
	Option		"SendCoreEvents"	"true"
	Option		"Device"		"/dev/psaux"
	Option		"Protocol"		"auto-dev"
	Option		"HorizScrollDelta"	"0"
EndSection

restart the X server, then

  b. execute this command
$ synclient TouchpadOff=1

  b'. automated version, System > Preferences > Sessions > (Startup
  Programs tab) New
synclient TouchpadOff=1

java under firefox
    somehowe installed java, then
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jre1.6.0_01/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/libjavaplugin_oji.so  
    go figure

fix emacs M-x print-buffer
  found a decent fix, use Postscript print buffer 
  M-x ps-print-buffer

General comments: some configuring has been a pain, but overall,
installs are easy and there's documentation out there.  I like the
distro so far after a week of fussing and experimenting.

installed google toolbar, this let me choose to have gmail be my default
mail client, so when you click on a mailto link, you go straight to a
compose message window in gmail.  There's a lot more there that I'll
have to experiment with.

just discovered a problem with dvips for tex files.  Somehow the file
just does not go to the printer.  A workaround is

% dvips -t letter -o filename.ps filename.dvi
% lpr filename.ps

but I need to figure out how to configure dvips properly.

another problem: function buttons (F1 F2 etc) for which I have defined
keyboard shortcuts for emacs have been taken over by the terminal.  Need
to unset the terminal behavior and give the control back to emacs.
