tex distribution seems to have changed.  packages such as beamer and
xypic do not seem to be included in the install package anymore.  the
base package seems to be now called texlive.  here's how to fix beamer.

get beamer, pgf and xcolor from sourceforge

tar xvzf latex-beamer-3.07.tar.gz
tar xzvf xcolor-2.00.tar.gz
tar xvzf pgf-1.01.tar.gz

sudo mkdir -p /etc/texmf/tex/latex/{beamer,pgf,xcolor}

sudo mv latex-beamer-3.07/* /etc/texmf/tex/latex/beamer/
sudo mv pgf-1.01/* /etc/texmf/tex/latex/pgf/
sudo mv xcolor/* /etc/texmf/tex/latex/xcolor/

sudo texhash

fixed xy-pic problem, found solution at this URL
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/texlive-base/2007.dfsg.1-2

sudo apt-get install texlive-pictures

also did this, may fix epsf problem

 sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-recommended

finally did this, maybe this will nuke all the problems

 sudo apt-get install texlive-full

installed mathematica 6.0 from cd.  first there was an install problem,
had to install libstdc++5.  then mathematica installed, but doesn't run
right.  fonts don't show up, get lots of error messages.  workaround is

% mathematica -defaultvisual

had to do this to install c compiler
jeez, you'd think this would be set up by default!
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
