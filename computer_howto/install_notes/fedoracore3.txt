Upgrade to Fedora Core 3 from RedHat 9
IBM ThinkPad G40 laptop

Downloaded Fedora Core 3 iso files from www.redhat.com

burned these to 4 CDs

PROBLEM: disks 2 and 3 did not fit onto CDs using cdrecord.  We finally
tried x-cd-roast and it worked.  Definitely run the media check that
install disk 1 provides to make sure your install CDs are OK.

Installed 4 CDs.  All packages.

Adjusted monitor setting to 1024x768 (did not autodetect).

Downloaded fvwm from www.fvwm.org, built from .tar.gz

RedHat still has up2date, but we used yum to get updates.  Ran fine.
% yum update

Fedora Core 3 does not autodetect the winmodem.  Still using pcmcia
modem. 

6 and 7/2005

  configured emacs to type, display and print hangul

  installed hlatex package and fonts, see separate pages

8/2005

  experiments with thunderbird mail and sylpheed
  installed vm, changed mail to pop service through vm
