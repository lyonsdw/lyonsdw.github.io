***** The Farmer and the Animals ****
*************************************

A farmer is walking home with her fox, goose, and bucket of corn.  She
comes to a river that she has to cross in a small boat--a boat so small
that she can take only one animal or the bucket in the boat with her.  The
problem is that if she takes the corn first, and leaves the fox and
goose alone on the riverbank, the fox will eat the goose.  If she takes
the fox and leaves the goose and corn alone, the goose will eat the
corn.  

How can the farmer get all three--fox, goose, and corn-- to the other
side of the river, taking only one at a time and never leaving the fox
alone with the goose, nor the goose alone with the corn?

If you find a way to do this, can you find a way that takes fewer trips
across the river?  How few is the fewest?  How do you convince someone
that there is no way to do it with fewer trips?
