Two opposite sides of the board are labeled X and the other two sides
are labeled O (any two symbols will do).  Two players choose which will
play X and which will play O.  Players take turns placing their symbols
inside any empty hexagon.  The object is to connect your two edges of
the board with a continuous chain of your symbols.  The player who
constructs such a chain wins.
