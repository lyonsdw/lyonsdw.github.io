<h2>The "Jane Slugger" Puzzle</h2>

Jane Slugger leads the league in batting average for three years
straight, yet she does <i>not</i> have the highest three year average!
How is this possible?

<p>

This sounds impossible at first, but in fact it can happen.  Try to invent
batting records for Jane and another player, so that Jane has a
higher average than the other player for three years in a row, but the
other player has a higher cumulative average.  

<p>

The formula for batting averages is
<pre>
       (# hits)
  ------------------  .
   (# times at bat)
</pre>
