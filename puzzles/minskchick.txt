			 The Chicken From Minsk
	  ####################################################

The Chicken from Minsk is traveling across Brazil.  While walking along,
the Chicken from Minsk comes to a long rope which has been stretched
tightly around the earth's equator, and is afraid to step over the rope.
A witch doctor steps in to help by cutting the rope, inserting a 10 foot
section of new rope, retying the belt around the earth, and casting a
magic spell which causes the rope to hover at a uniform distance above
the surface of the earth.

The question is this:  Is the rope now high enough for the Chicken from
Minsk, who is 1 foot tall, to walk under?
