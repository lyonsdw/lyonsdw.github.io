***** Making Change ************ ****
*************************************

(Oliver, age 6, suggested this puzzle.)

Oliver was thinking about money, and thought of 4 different ways to make
up 25 cents:

1. 	1 quarter
2.	2 dimes and 1 nickel
3.	1 dime and 3 nickels
4.	5 nickels

Then I thought of more ways.  For instance, you could use

5. 	2 dimes and 5 pennies

How many ways are there in all?

How many different ways are there to make change for a dollar?

For algebra students:
Could you write a formula for how many ways there are to make change for
D dollars and C cents (an algebraic expression in terms of D and C)?
