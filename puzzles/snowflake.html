<h1>The Koch Snowflake</h1>

The <i>Koch Snowflake</i> is the final curve (on the right) in the
sequence of curves below.

<p>
The pictures indicate how the snowflake curve evolves.  Begin with an
equilateral triangle.  The next curve is obtained by removing the middle
third of each side of the triangle and then bridging the gap with two
sides of a new, smaller equilateral triangle.
<p>

Schematically, each side is undergoing a "replacement".

<pre>


                                                /\
                                               /  \
                             ----->           /    \          
   ________________________          ________/      \________
			           
</pre>

<p>

Similarly, once we have reached the <i>n</i>th iteration of the
snowflake curve, the <i>(n+1)</i>st iteration is obtained by removing the
middle third of each line segment and bridging the gap with two sides of
a smaller equilateral triangle.  Another way to say this is that each
side undergoes the replacement pictured above, on the appropriate scale.

<p>

The snowflake is the limiting figure obtained by this procedure.

<h2>Length and Area</h2>

The snowflake curve has the very interesting property that it has finite
area but infinite boundary length.  

<p>
You can see that the area is finite by drawing a circle around the
figure.  For a nice exercise, see if you can write a geometric series
for the area and find the sum.

<p>
To see that the length of the boundary is infinite, just notice that the
length of the curve at iteration <i>n</i> is 4/3 times the length of the
curve at the previous iteration, as is apparent from the "replacement"
sketch.
