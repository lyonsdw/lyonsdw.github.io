************* Sorting Game ****************
*******************************************

Suppose you have buckets labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  (Any number will do,
so let's choose six to start with.)  Take six balls, also labeled 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, and 6, and mix them up in some order (any order) and place one
ball in each bucket.  The game is now to sort the balls so the number on
the ball matches the number on the bucket.  The moves you are allowed
are to switch (transpose) any two balls in any pair of buckets which sit
side by side (buckets that are adjacent).  Each switch (transposition)
counts as one move.  Write down the starting order of the balls, and see
how few moves you can take to sort them into "home" position, that is,
where every ball is in the bucket with the matching number.  

Example:

Say the buckets are laid out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, left to right, and the
order of the balls in them is

 2  3  5  1  6  4.

Your first move might be to switch ball number 2 with ball number 3.
Then you would have

 3  2  5  1  6  4.

Then you might continue with more moves like this:

 3  2  1  5  6  4     	(by switching 5 and 1)

 3  1  2  5  6  4       (by switching 1 and 2)

 1  3  2  5  6  4	(by switching 1 and 3)

and so on.  Remember, only one switch for each move, and only switch
balls next to each other.

See if you can solve these puzzles about this game.

1.  Can you find the fewest number of moves to sort the balls in the
sample game?

2.  Mix the balls up again and play with new starting layout.  Play with
a friend and see who can find a shorter way to sort the balls.

3.  Is there only one way to sort the balls that is shortest, or are
there more ways?  How many ways are there?

4.  Can you tell by looking at the original layout of the balls the
smallest number of switches it will take to sort them?

Here are some ideas for solving the puzzles.

1.  Try the game with only 2 or 3 balls.  Try to solve the puzzles for
those games.

2.  Can you make up a layout that will take more switches to sort than
any other layout?  Again, try to solve this question for 2 or 3 balls.
