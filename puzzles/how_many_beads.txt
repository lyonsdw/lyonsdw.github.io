***** How Many Beads in the Jar? ****
*************************************

Suppose you know that an empty jar weighs one pound.  After you fill the
jar with beads, you find that it weighs five pounds.  Then you have four
pounds of beads.  Now suppose you know that each bead weighs (on
average) one quarter ounce.  How many beads are in the jar?  (You'll
need to find out how many ounces are in a pound.)

Here's another variation with an extra challenge.  Suppose a lego
construction weighs 40 pounds total, and you know that each lego piece
(on average) weighs a fifth of an ounce.  Now you find out that the
pieces have been glued together, and that the glue adds 5 percent to the
weight of the legos that have been glued.  How many pieces are in the
construction?  Be careful:  the weight of the glue is *not* 5 percent of
the 40 pounds; rather, the weight of the glue is 5 percent of the weight
of the *lego*, and the total weight of glue and lego is 40 pounds.
Tricky, huh?  Try it, you clever gooses!
