			  Pythagorean Triples

Three positive integers a, b, and c are called a Pythagorean triple if
they are the lengths of three sides of a right triangle.  Pythagoras'
theorem says that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (assuming c is the length of the
hypoteneuse).  

Can you describe all Pythagorean triples?  That is, can you give a
method or algorithm for generating all positive integer solutions to the
equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 ?

You will quickly see that this question is the same as the following:
find all points on the unit circle (the set of points in the x,y plane
which are solutions to the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 ) with both the x and
y coordinate rational (a rational number is a number that can be
expressed as a fraction m/n of integers, n not zero).

Can you describe all the rational points on the 2-sphere?  The n-sphere?

			 A Connectedness Puzzle

(This is a point-set topology puzzle.  For definitions of the terms
involved, see any elemetary topology text.)

Our puzzle takes place in the unit square S = [0,1] x [0,1] in the
plane.  Take the midpoints of the edges P1 = (1/2,0) , P2 = (1/2,1) , 
Q1 = (0,1/2) and Q2 = (1,1/2).  Can you find two disjoint connected
subsets K and L of S, such that K contains P1 and P2, and L contains Q1
and Q2?  If not, prove it can't be done.

Give a truly geometric proof that any nontrivial orientation preserving
rigid motion of 3-space is a rotation about some axis.

"Truly geometric" means don't use linear algebra or quaternions, etc.  The
real challenge is to make a proof that explains, in a geometrically clear
and believable way, why this fact is true!

"Nontrivial" means not the identity.

"Orientation preserving" means the motion can be carried out in 3-space.

"Rigid" means no distortion of distances.
