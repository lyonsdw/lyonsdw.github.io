<h1>The Corner Game</h1>

Choose any four numbers and put them on the vertices of a square.  Now
make a new square by taking the absolute values of the differences of
numbers on the original square to label the vertices of the new square.

<p>

For example, say you start with the labels 2, 5, 3, and 7 on the corners
of your square like this.

<pre>
2   5

7   3
</pre>

Your next square would then be

<pre>
3   2

4   5
</pre>

where you place the differences in order as you take them around the
first square (remember to take the positive differences).  It does not
matter what vertex you start with each time.

<p>

Now continue to make new squares in succession until you reach "the
end".  Try some different starting numbers.  Amazing, huh?  Prove that
this always happens.  What about polygons with a different number of
sides?  Try the triangle (1,1,0).  Try 5, 6, and 7 sides, then try 8.
Pretty amazing, huh?
