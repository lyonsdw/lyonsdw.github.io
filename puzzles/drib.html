<h1>A Zeno's Paradox Problem</h1>

The following problem is a version of <i>Zeno's paradox</i>.  It is 
taken from an article by George Andrews in the January 1998
issue of the <i>American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 105 No. 1</i> and is
attributed to a Prof. Sleator.

<p>

Two trees are one mile apart.  A drib flies from one tree to the other
and back, making the first trip at 10 miles per hour, the return at 20
miles per hour, the next at 40 and so on, each successive mile at twice
the speed of the preceeding.  When will the drib be in both trees at the
same time?  Hint:  Write an expression for the time it takes to travel
<i>n</i> miles.  What happens as <i>n</i> goes to infinity?
