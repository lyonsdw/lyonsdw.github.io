<h2>Simpson's Paradox Puzzles</h2>

Jane Slugger leads the league in batting average for three years
straight, yet she does <i>not</i> have the highest three year average!
How is this possible?

<p>

This sounds impossible, but in fact it can happen.  This phenomenon of
apparent reversal of averages is called <i>Simpson's Paradox</i>.

<p>

Invent batting records for Jane and another player to see how this works.
Jane should have a higher average than the other player for three years
in a row, but the other player should have a higher cumulative average.

<p>

The formula for batting averages is
<pre>
       (# hits)
  ------------------  .
   (# times at bat)
</pre>

Here's another version of the same problem.  Salary data for factory
workers at the X Company are divided into three categories: 1 to 3 years
of employment (junior); 4 to 8 years of employment (intermediate); and 9 
years and higher (senior).  The average salary for women is higher in
all three categories, but the overall men's average salary is higher!
How can this happen?
