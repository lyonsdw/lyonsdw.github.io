	<statement>
	  <p>Let <m>G</m> be a group and let <m>X</m> be a
	  set. An <term>action</term> of the group <m>G</m> on the
	    set <m>X</m> is a group homomorphism
	    <me>\phi \colon G\to \Perm(X).</me> For <m>g\in G</m>
	    and <m>x\in X</m>, we write <m>gx</m> to
	    denote <m>(\phi(g))(x)</m>.<fn>Beware of potential ambiguity
	      in the notation `<m>gx</m>'. For example, 
	      when <m>X</m> is a group and <m>G</m> is a subgroup
	    of <m>X</m>, the usual meaning of symbols
	    `<m>gx</m>'  is the product of the group elements <m>g,x</m> under the group
	      operation. But in the context of an action of <m>G</m>
	    on <m>X</m>, the value of <m>(\phi(g))(x)</m> may be
	      different from the product <m>gx</m>. In this case,
	  it is necessary to be explicit and write
	    <m>(\phi(g))(x)</m>, or use some other notation.</fn> We write <m>\Orb(x)</m> to
	    denote the set 
	    <me>\Orb(x)=\{gx\colon g\in g\},</me> called
	    the <term>orbit</term> of <m>x</m>, 
	    and we write <m>\Stab(x)</m> to denote the set
	    <me>\Stab(x) = \{g\in G\colon gx=x\},</me>
	    called the <term>stabilizer</term> of <m>x</m>. A group
	    action is <term>transitive</term><idx>transitive group
	      action</idx> if there is only one orbit. A group action
	    is <term>faithful</term><idx>faithful group action</idx> if
	    the kernel of the map <m>G\to \Perm(X)</m> has a trivial kernel.

    <exercise><title>Actions of a group on

	  three actions <m>G\to \Perm(G)</m> of <m>G</m> on itself. 
	  <term>Left multiplication</term><idx>left multiplication</idx>
	  is given
	  by <me>g\to L_g</me>, where <m>L_g</m> is given
	  by <m>L_g(h)=gh</m>.
	  	  <term>Right multiplication</term><idx>right multiplication</idx>
	  is given
		  by <me>g\to R_g</me>, where <m>R_g</m> is given
	  by <m>R_g(h)=hg</m>.
	  <term>Conjugation</term>
	  is given
	by <me>g\to C_g</me>, where <m>C_g</m> is given
	  by <m>C_g(h)=ghg^{-1}</m>.
	  Show that each of these
	      maps <m>L,R,C</m> is indeed a group action.

    <exercise><title>Cosets, revisted</title><statement><p>Let <m>H</m>
	  be a subgroup of a group <m>G</m>, and consider the map

	  where <m>R_h(g)=gh</m> (this is just the restriction of the

	  Show that the orbits of this action of <m>H</m> on <m>G</m>
	  are the same as the cosets of <m>H</m>. This shows that the two
	  meanings, potentially different, of <m>G/H</m> in fact
