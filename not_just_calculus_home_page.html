  <h1>Not Just Calculus: First-Year Introduction to Upper-Level Mathematics</h1>

  <h2>About the Textbook</h2>
  
 <p>This free, online text is designed to be used as 1-semester or
 2-semester course for first-year mathematical sciences students.
 </p>

<p>The purpose of this text is to provide a first-year introduction to
  upper-level mathematics in the undergraduate curriculum. <em>Not just
  calculus</em>, this book remediates the narrow focus of secondary
  mathematics education. Acknowledging that a single course on proof
  writing in the second year is too little, too late, this book is
  designed to accelerate the process of "mathematical maturity" through
  actively reading, reasoning, and writing on topics that will be useful
  in later courses.
</p>

<p>
  This text can be used for a one-semester course, or for two
  half-credit courses spread over two semesters in the first year. This
  text is <em>not</em> intended to replace a formal introduction to
  proof writing. It <em>is</em> intended to widen student's perspectives
  beyond high school mathematics and introductory calculus courses.
</p>

<p>
The exposition is overtly designed for active reading. There are almost
no examples, and almost no illustrating figures. Embedded reading
exercises ("Checkpoints") require the reader to construct examples and
make drawings. End-of-section problems ("Exercises") guide students in constructing
short arguments to prove if-then propositions. An overall theme is that
a few carefully chosen, powerful abstractions (such as: sets and
functions, modular arithmetic, linear transformations of the plane, to
name a few) form the basis for widely various applications.
