\begin{public notes}
Notes which will appear on the public display output go here.  The
following is what I have used recently:

A negative score means an excused missed assignment. 

Grading procedure after the final exam: Of all your scores which do not exceed
your final exam score, the one which most adversely affects your average will be
dropped.  Grading policy is subject to change and the discretion of the
instructor.
