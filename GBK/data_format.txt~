				  Data Format

Each input file must have a title, assignment, and student records section.
Grade scale, notes, and public notes are optional.  The title should fit on one
line.  Assignments are listed in groups, beginning with a group name (Homework,
Quiz, Exam, etc) followed by a weight for the group, with a percent sign,
followed by the total point value for the assignments within that group listed
in order.  The size of the group is determined by how many point values are
listed.  Group names may contain no digits or the minus sign.  Only white space
characters should separate the group names, weights, and point values.

Grade scale input consists of a letter grade followed by its minimum cutoff
score (in percent), then the next letter grade, etc.  See the example below.
Exceptions to letter grade assignments may be made by listing the ID strings for
each exception followed by a replacement grade.

Student records are delimited within the student section by blank lines.  Each
student record consists of an ID string, which terminates with a space, followed
by a name which terminates with a newline character.  If the last four
characters in an ID string are "PRIV", then that student's record will not be
written to the public posting output files.  Raw assignment scores follow,
listed in order, separated by spaces.  Text may occur between scores to make
input more readable.  Finally you may include individual comments for a student.

It is suggested that you use the grade entering facility (from the menu) to
enter your grades.
