<h1> Grade Book Program </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

Freely sharable, weighted average gradebook program, available for downloading
from this web page.  Produces various custom reports, including grade records
for instructors, grade records for students, class lists, and statistical
summaries including histograms.

<h2>Version</h2>

<h2> General information </h2>

Gbk (for "gradebook") is a simple program, written in java, for managing class
grade information.  My premise is that grading is a simple task (just tally up
some averages and make some suitable output) which does not require graphical
interface or all the bells and whistles of a typical spreadsheet program.  This
project was partially motivated by the frustration of having perfectly useful
and simple spreadsheet programs become obsolete due to "upgrading", i.e.,
planned obsolescence on the part of commercial software companies.

<p>

If you find that you use the same grading methods each semester,
your grade policy is to use simple weighted averages, and you have been
frustrated with spreadsheets, you might like to try this program.  

<h2>Sample input and output files</h2>

Use your text editor to maintain a "latex" style <a href="sample.input.txt">
data file </a>.  Grades for each assignment can be entered using gbk or by using
your editor directly.  Gbk then produces a <a href="gbk.grades.txt"> grade
display for the instructor </a>, a <a href="gbk.post.txt"> grade display for the
students</a>, a <a href="gbk.hist.txt"> histogram </a> of score distributions, a
<a href="gbk.stats.txt"> statistical summary </a>and a <a href="gbk.list.txt">
class list </a>.  You may choose to get a histogram of cumulative averages or of
scores for any given assignment.  I use the class list for my homework grader to
write weekly scores and return them to me.  I post the student grade display on
a course information web page.  In order to preserve anonymity, the order of the
student records in the public display is randomly permuted each time you run
gbk.

<h2>Source code and documentation</h2>

Here is how to download and run gbk.  
<ol> 

<li> Create a grades
directory, say, called "grades".  Create a subdirectory called "GBK2_9".

<li> Download all the files in this web directory into your GBK2_10
  directory.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="GBK2_10">GBK2_10 directory with java and class
	files</a>
      </ul>
  Previous versions:
  <ul>
<li><a href="GBK2_9">GBK2_9 directory with java and class files</a>
<li><a href="GBK2_8">GBK2_8 directory with java and class files</a>
  </ul>
<li> Download the <a href="template.txt"> blank data file
template</a> into your grades directory and use a text editor to modify
it appropriately for your class.  

<li> In your grades directory, run the
gradebook program with 
<pre> 
java GBK2_10/GradeBook [filename | -e filename| -h filename] 
</pre> 

The -e option takes you directly to a grade entry routine.  The -h
option takes you directly to a choice of histograms.  If no filename is
specified, gbk begins with a menu of choices.

<li>Put shell scripts <a href="sendem">sendem</a>
  and <a href="sendem">sendconfirmation</a> in your grades directory.
  Make sure they are executable.  These scripts are called by gbk to
  send individual email grade reports to students.  You also need to
  configure and enable sendmail on your computer.  For ubuntu linux,
  this is accomplished by installing the mailx package.
</ol>

Let me know what you think of gbk if you try it, and please continue
to share gbk freely.
