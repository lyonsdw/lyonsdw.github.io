Wecome to the Math Vista project home page! Math Vista is a collection
of videos that address motivation, theme, and illumination of important
ideas in undergraduate mathematics courses.

<p>

Math Vista videos supplement course texts and classroom lectures with:
<ul>
<li>"big picture" talks that span entire courses or large pieces of courses; and
<li>enrichments on important topics aimed at providing insight and
  understanding where texts emphasize technique and procedure.
</ul>
Textbooks tell you <i>how</i>; we aim to elucidate <i>why</i>
and explore basic workings behind important ideas in some key places in
the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. Math Vista is not a
replacement for textbooks or class lectures. It is an additional
resource aimed at bringing topics to life.

<h3>The Videos</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href = "http://youtu.be/l_nnDIRb70E"><h4>Sequences of Approximations</h4></a> Using examples from a second
  semester calculus course, we illustrate this powerful concept that
  pervades mathematical theory and application.
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/_MxCXGF9N-8"><h4>Why Linear Algebra?</h4></a> Linear algebra studies the dynamics of
  the simplest possible interactions among multiple variables. Its
  fundamentals are essential to all areas of mathematics.
<!--Linear algebra is to mathematics as
  keyboard theory is to music. You don't have to be a brilliant keyboard
  player or music theory expert to play well, but lack of a basic level
  of understanding of theory really limits a musician. Similarly, linear
  algebra shows up in all areas of mathematics; mastery of its
  fundamentals is essential.-->
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/Ay8ekNhldDM"><h4>The Cross Product</h4></a> This workhorse of classical vector
  calculus is an elegant solution to a natural problem. This video
  brings into focus what the cross product is <i>about</i>
  and <i>why</i> it works.
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/i_1jBGRmS0U"><h4>Zeno's Paradox, Part I: A Puzzle and A Flaw</h4></a> One of the most
  powerful and basic strategies in problem solving is: (1) break a
  large, complicated problem into smaller, simpler pieces; (2) solve the
  smaller problems, and; (3) reassemble those small solutions into one
  large solution. Zeno of Elia (a Greek philosopher in the 400s BCE)
  posed stark thought experiments that go right to the heart of what can
  go wrong with this process. We continue to learn valuable lessons by
  studying Zeno's paradoxes.
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/SAkuWp0V7QA"><h4>Zeno's Paradox, Part II: Geometric Sequences</h4></a> A closer
  examination of details of the smaller and larger problems of Zeno's
  paradox leads to an amazingly useful pattern called <i>geometric
  sequence</i>.
