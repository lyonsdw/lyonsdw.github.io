This document describes details of the procedure used to determine
cumulative average and letter grades.  Grading policies and procedures
are subject to adjustment at any time at the discretion of the
instructor.

<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>

Your semester grade is determined by two components: one is
<i>quantitative</i> and the other <i>qualitative</i>.  The quantitative
component is the cumulative weighted average of graded work items (such
as quizzes, writing assignments, and exams) that have numerical scores.  The
qualitative component is determined by participation and engagement.

<p>

Each item of graded work receives a <i>raw point score</i>.  The
numerical grade, or simply the <i>score</i>, for an item of graded work
is the raw point score divided by the total number of possible points
for that item.
<pre>
               raw point score
   score =  ---------------------
            total possible points
</pre>
For example, if Joe Student has a raw point score of 18 on a quiz that has
20 total possible points, then Joe's grade for that quiz is 18/20 = .9
= 90%.  Most of the remainder of this document is devoted to the
procedure used to compute an overall cumulative average from the
individual graded items.

<p>

The way in which class participation and attendance affect your semester
grade is described in the final section below.

<h3>  Weighted Averages </h3>

The <b><i>weighted average</i></b> of a list of numbers 
<pre align>
   x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

with <b><i>weights</i></b> given by the list of nonnegative numbers
<pre>
   w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

not all of which are zero, is the quantity 
<pre>
   x<sub>1</sub>w<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>w<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub>w<sub>3</sub> + ... + x<sub>n</sub>w<sub>n</sub> 
   ------------------------------ .
      w<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub> + w<sub>3</sub> + ... + w<sub>n</sub>
</pre>

<h4>Example</h4>
Joe Student has test scores of 79%, 86%, and 73%.  The tests
have weights 25/100, 40/100, and 35/100, respectively.  The weighted
average of the three test scores is
<pre>
   (.79)(25/100) + (.86)(40/100) + (.73)(35/100)
   ---------------------------------------------  = .797 = 79.7%.
            25/100 + 40/100 + 35/100
</pre>
If the weights are changed to 1, 3, and 2, the new weighted average
becomes
<pre>
   (.79)(1) + (.86)(3) + (.73)(2)
   ------------------------------  = .805 = 80.5%.
             1 + 3 + 2 
</pre>

<h3>Forgiveness of one low score</h3>

At the end of the semester, the grading software will automatically
drop one graded item (but not your final exam score) from your
cumulative average by resetting its weight to zero; the
grading software will determine which of your graded items to
drop by choosing the one that most increases your overall
cumulative average by dropping it. If there is no item that increases
your cumulative average by dropping it, then no dropping will occur.

<p>
  
<i>Note: grade dropping is only applied in courses that have a final exam.</i>

<h3>Excused missed assignments</h3>

Missed assignments may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor. An excused graded item is dropped from your
grade record by resetting its weight to zero.

<p>

  There are no makeups for missed assignments or exams.

<h3>Meaning of letter grades</h3>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for ``excellent'' and ``good'' (letter grades A and B) are high.
<!--Some students experience a culture shock when they earn a C for
satisfactory work that may have earned a B or an A in secondary school. -->
In this course, your grade reflects your mastery of the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h3>Determination of letter grade</h3>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to letter
grades is based on the ``standard 10 point scale'' (A for 90% and above, B
for 80% and above, C for 70% and above, etc.), but the scale may be
adjusted, at the discretion of the instructor, so that the meanings of the
letter grades fit the descriptions given in the previous section.

<p>

Pluses and minuses are used to distinguish between the low, middle and
high achievers within each letter grade category.  This is where the
qualitative assessment of participation and engagement has an effect.
For example, there may be a group of students with final cumulative
averages in the high 80s.  A student in this group who showed consistent
effort in class and during office hours might receive a B+, while a
student never came to office hours, did not say much during class
discussions, and had several unexcused absences might earn a B.
