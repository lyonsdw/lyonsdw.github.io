<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
  growth</b>. This involves understanding mathematical concepts,
  analysis and problem solving, and clear, concise communication.
  Achievement of course goals requires desire for learning, willingness
  to work hard, time (at least two hours on homework outside of
  class for each hour in class), and persistence. Student learning objectives 
  include the following.
<ul>
<li><b>understanding of mathematical concepts</b>
<li><b>analysis and problem solving skills</b> 
<li><b>clear, concise communication skills</b>
<li><b>mastery of the course material</b> at a satisfactory
  level (grade `C') or higher
</ul>


<h3>Course Schedule</h3>

The schedule for reading assignments, exercises, class discussions,
and exams is posted on a separate Course Calendar on
the course web pages. Writing assignments and due dates will be
announced in class. The schedule is subject to change.


<h3>Graded Work</h3>
<i>Note: Grading and other course policies are subject to change at the
  discretion of the instructor.</i>

<p>
  
Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights.

  <b>Minimum Engagement Requirement (policy amendment effective
  2/8/2017): </b> More than 3 unexcused absences or more than 3
  unexcused missed writing assignments will result in an automatic
  failing grade for the course. This policy takes effect beginning
  2/8/2017. It will not be applied retroactively; counting absences and
  missed assignments for this policy amendment begins 2/8.
  -->

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing. A homework
time guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience.

<p>

  <h4><b>Homework Instructions</b></h4>

  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make lists or note cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a solution?
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact lists or note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
		      noted previously? 
  </ul>
  

  <h3>Writing</h3>

  The purpose of writing assignments is understanding course material
  and improving communication skills.  Write solutions in
  narrative form using one or more complete sentences. Show details of
  necessary calculations. Show your understanding by using appropriate
  vocabulary and citing appropriate facts. Writing must be sufficiently
  clear for readability using the classroom projection system.

  <p>Writing assignments for 100 and 200 level classes will be graded for preparation and completeness, not
    for correctness.

    <p>Writing assignments for 300 and 400 level classes will be graded
    for completeness and correctness.

<p>
  <i>Heads up!</i> Writing assignments and due dates are <i>NOT</i>
  posted on the course calendar. Writing assignments and due dates will
  be announced in class, one at a time, in order to synch with the pace
  of the class. Missing an assignment announcement due to absence, even
  if that absence is excused (see the attendance policy stated below), is not a
  valid excuse for missing a writing assignment.

  <p>
  Here are
  grading rubrics for writing assignments.

    using a document camera or computer. Solution is written using
    complete sentences. Writing is clear and large enough to be
    readable using the classroom projection system. </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    
</table>

  <h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

Note on scoring for final exams: final exams may be scored on a 2-point
rubric. On this scale, 2 points corresponds to 5 points in the table
above, 1 point corresponds to 2, 3, or 4 points in the table above, and
0 points corresponds to 0 or 1 point in the table above.

<p>

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected.  Absences may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor. Here is the procedure to follow if you wish to have an
absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed class day, with a complete
  explanation for having to miss class.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send email notice as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed class.
      <li>Turn in any writing assignment(s) due on the day of the absence
      by 5pm of the same day. In extreme circumstances, missed
      assignments may be excused.
  </ul>

<h3>Late or Missed Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

Missed exams or assignments may be excused if the assignment is missed
due to an excused absence (see the previous section attendance).  If a
late or missed assignment is not excused, it receives a score of
zero. There are no extra credit or makeup assignments or exams.


<h3>Class Engagement</h3>

Class time is for engagement with the subject. In consideration of
learning and out of politeness to others, please be focused and present
of mind, and please observe the following.
<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging and web surfing are rude behaviors that distract everyone
  from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the room once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>
In addition to focus and engagement with the subject, class meetings
presume politeness and kindness.

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>IDEA Survey</h3>

Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey called the Individual Development
and Educational Assessment ("the IDEA survey").
Of the twelve objectives on which it is based, the three most
applicable to this course are the following.
<ul>
<li>Gaining factual knowledge (terminology, classifications, methods,
 trends) 
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories 
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
 solving, and decisions) 
</ul>
