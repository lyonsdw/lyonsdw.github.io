<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
  growth</b>. This involves understanding mathematical concepts,
  analysis and problem solving, and clear, concise communication.
  Achievement of course goals requires desire for learning, willingness
  to work hard, time (at least two hours on homework outside of
  class for each hour in class), and persistence. Student learning objectives 
  include the following.
<ul>
<li><b>understanding of mathematical concepts</b>
<li><b>analysis and problem solving skills</b> 
<li><b>clear, concise communication skills</b>
<li><b>mastery of the course material</b> at a satisfactory
  level (grade `C') or higher
</ul>


<h3>Course Calendar</h3>

The calendar for reading assignments, exercises, class discussions,
and exams is posted on Canvas. The calendar is subject to change.


<h3>Graded Work</h3>
<i>Note: Grading and other course policies are subject to change at the
  discretion of the instructor.</i>

<p>
  
Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights.

<p>
  <b>Minimum Engagement Requirement (policy amendment effective
  2/8/2017): </b> More than 3 unexcused absences or more than 3
  unexcused missed writing assignments will result in an automatic
  failing grade for the course. This policy takes effect beginning
  2/8/2017. It will not be applied retroactively; counting absences and
  missed assignments for this policy amendment begins 2/8.
  -->

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing. A homework
time guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience.

<p>

  <h4><b>Homework Instructions</b></h4>

  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make vocabulary study cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a solution?
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
		      noted previously? 
  </ul>

  <h4><b>Graded Homework Assignment Instructions</b></h4>

Homework assignments are due, via file upload to Canvas, before midnight on the day before each
  class meeting, except for exam days. Each graded homework assignment
  has two parts:
  <ul>
    <li><b>vocabulary notecards</b> for the text sections on the calendar for the
  <b>next class meeting</b>, and
    <li><b>solutions to problems</b> for the text sections on the calendar for
    the <b>previous class meeting</b>.
      </ul>
Each homework assignment submission consists of photos or scanned images
  of your vocabulary notecards and problem solutions.

<p>
  
  The purpose of vocabulary notecards is to learn course material. The
  purpose of writing solutions is understanding course material and
  improving communication skills.  Write solutions in narrative form
  using one or more complete sentences. Show details of necessary
  calculations. Show your understanding by using appropriate vocabulary
  and citing appropriate facts. Writing must be sufficiently clear for
  readability using the classroom projection system.

<p>
  
  Here are
  instructions for the two parts of each homework assignment.

<p>
  
  <h4>Vocabulary notecards</h4> Make a notecard for each definition or fact in
  the reading section. The term being defined or the name of the fact is on the front of the
  card, and the definition of the term or the statement of the fact (written using one or more complete
  sentences) is on the back. A sample notecard is posted
  on the course web pages.

  <h4>Solutions to problems</h4>  Write solutions to problems using one
  or more complete sentences. Use appropriate vocabulary, and show main
  steps of calculations. Sample solution write-ups are posted on the
  course web pages.

  <h4>Homework Grading Rubric</h4>

  Homework submissions will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the grading rubric for writing
    assignments.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Homework Grading Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Score</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and solutions to problems are fully
    prepared. Solutions are written using complete sentences. Photos or
    scanned images are clear enough for readability on the classroom
    projection system.  </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> One or more vocabulary notecards or written solutions are
    partially, but not fully, prepared OR some of the submission is not
   clear enough to be readable using the classroom
    projection system.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and written solutions are not prepared, or
    are unreadable, or not turned in before the deadline. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>
  
  
  
    <h3>In-class</h3>

  In-class activities will be graded for participation,
    not for correctness. Here is the grading rubric for in-class activities.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">In-Class Activities Grading Rubric</th>

    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> Student arrives late, does not fully participate in in-class
    activities, or interferes with the participation of others.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Student is absent or does not participate in in-class
    activities.</td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>
    
    
    <h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Exam Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary where prompted. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

</table>  

<p>
  
Note on scoring for final exams: final exams may be scored on a 2-point
rubric. On this scale, 2 points corresponds to 5 points in the table
above, 1 point corresponds to 2, 3, or 4 points in the table above, and
0 points corresponds to 0 or 1 point in the table above.

<p>

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected.  Absences may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor. Here is the procedure to follow if you wish to have an
absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed class day, with a complete
  explanation for having to miss class.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send email notice as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed class.
  </ul>

<h3>Missed Exams and Extra Credit</h3>

Missed exams may be excused if the exam is missed
due to an excused absence (see the previous section attendance).  If a
exam absence is not excused, it receives a score of
zero. There are no extra credit or makeup assignments or exams.


<h3>Class Engagement</h3>

Class time is for engagement with the subject. In consideration of
learning and out of politeness to others, please be focused and present
of mind, and please observe the following.
<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging and web surfing are rude behaviors that distract everyone
  from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the room once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>
In addition to focus and engagement with the subject, class meetings
presume politeness and kindness.

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>Student Opinion Survey</h3>


Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey. More details TBA.

<!--
called the Individual Development
and Educational Assessment ("the IDEA survey").
Of the twelve objectives on which it is based, the three most
applicable to this course are the following.
<ul>
<li>Gaining factual knowledge (terminology, classifications, methods,
 trends) 
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories 
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
 solving, and decisions) 
</ul>
