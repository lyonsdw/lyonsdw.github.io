information.</i>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

Through a mix of reading, problem solving, writing and oral presentation, this
course examines the artistic and intellectual enterprise of mathematics
through a collection of topics organized around the theme <i>Reconciling
the impossible: some famous paradoxes and how they have taught us</i>
and the sub-theme <i>Hidden structure: tools to organize complex
problems</i>.  Paradoxes and impossibility results include Zeno's
paradox, Simpson's paradox, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Structure
and tools topics include pattern analysis using sequences, linear and
exponential growth, basic combinatorics, and an introduction to the
mathematics of symmetry.

<h3>Prerequisites and Requirements Met</h3>

There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra skills.  This course meets
the Liberal Studies Area 4 requirement of College's General Education Program.

<h3>Text and Materials</h3>

<ul>
<li>COMAP, <i>For All Practical Purposes</i>

<li>Lyons, <i>Course Notes</i>

<li>Calculator for homework and exams.  Business and graphing calculators are
  allowed, but not required.
</ul>

<h3>Graded Work</h3>
<i>Note: Grading and other course policies are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.</i>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights.  

<pre>
Exam 1                       25%
Exam 2                       25%
Final Exam                   30%
Presentation (10 minutes)    10% 
Writing Assignments          10%
</pre>

Detailed instructions for each assignment will be announced in class,
posted on the course web pages, or both. The final exam will be
comprehensive, including material from the entire course.

<h3>Schedule</h3>

The schedule for reading assignments, problems, discussion, exams,
writing assignments and presentations will be announced in class and
updated as we go. Tentative dates for exams (subject to change) are the
following. There will always be advance notice for all graded
assignments.

<pre>
Exam 1                            Wednesday  9/24
Exam 2                            Wednesday 11/12
Final Exam Section 1 (8am class)  Wednesday 12/10 9am
Final Exam Section 2 (9am class)  Friday    12/12 9am
</pre>

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, and solving problems. A homework time
management guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience.

<p>

<b><i>Recommendation</i></b>: Keep a notebook or binder for reading
notes, class notes, and homework solutions. Mark your questions clearly
and be sure to follow up until you gain understanding.


<h3>Exams</h3>

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned reading and
exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules will be announced in
advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive, including material from
the entire course. 

<p>

No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams.  

<h3>Presentations</h3>

The purpose of the presentation is to tell a story. Some aspect of theory or
applications of mathematics must be part of the story, but the content
need not be technical. The story should be interesting and exciting
to <i>you</i>, and your goal is to convey that interest and excitement
to your audience.

<p>

One of the grading criteria for presentations is critical
thinking. Storytelling should not just be reporting facts, but should
present your original thinking about the topic. A mediocre story tells
facts. An excellent story gives a critical analysis.

<p>

The possibilities for topics and sources are wide open. Here are a few
possibilities:
 
<ul>
<li>a novel solution or extended investigation of a problem from class
  or one of the texts
<li>a book <i>review</i> (but not a book <i>report</i>)
<li>your investigation and solution to a puzzle from a book or internet
  source
<li>a review of a news article
</ul>

<p>

<b>Comment on the meaning of "mathematics".</b> The term "mathematics"
means "to understand". Math is critical analysis that sheds new
understanding on some question or problem. Math is NOT: mere citing of
statistics; mere calculations (plugging numbers into formulas, or doing
arithmetic); or just data. Math IS: analyzing patterns or data or
statistics to understand something new. Your presentation must include at
least <i>some</i> nontrivial engagement with real mathematics as it
relates to your chosen topic.

<p>

The following subjects are strongly discouraged. If you pick one of
these, you'll have to make a careful case for intellectual merit as a
story that involves mathematics.
<ul>
<li> sports statistics, sometimes called "sabermetrics"
<li> numerology, number mysticism
<li> the golden ratio in art and nature (most of this is bogus)
<li> paranormal phenomena: ESP, UFOs, etc
<li> "new age" pseudo-science: quantum consciousness, etc
</ul>

<h4>Presentations Length and Format</h4>

<ul>
<li> length is 10 minutes, plus up to minutes for questions from the audience
<li> format is wide open: use voice, chalkboard, powerpoint, video, audience
  participation activity, music, etc
</ul>

<h3>Writing Assignments</h3>

Writing assignments include solutions to homework problems from the
texts and other problems given in class. Instructions and grading
criteria will be announced with each assignment.

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected.  Absences may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor.  If you must miss a class and wish to have the absence excused,
please give the instructor written notice, on paper or by email, as far as
possible in advance.  In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
is not possible, please send written notice as soon as you can.

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of
the instructor or consult any source for homework and other assignments.
You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your
own.</b> Your writing and presentations must be your own voice and your
own understanding.  You must use proper academic citation for any
material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious academic offense;
penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the college.

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.
