<i>Note: Course policies are subject to change at the
  discretion of the instructor.</i>

<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
  growth</b>. This involves understanding mathematical concepts,
  analysis and problem solving, and clear, concise communication.
  Achievement of course goals requires desire for learning, willingness
  to work hard, time (at least two hours on homework outside of
  class for each hour in class), and persistence. Student learning objectives 
  include the following.
<ul>
<li><b>understanding of mathematical concepts</b>
<li><b>analysis and problem solving skills</b> 
<li><b>clear, concise communication skills</b>
<li><b>mastery of the course material</b> at a satisfactory
  level (grade "C") or higher
</ul>


<h3>Course Calendar</h3>

The calendar for reading assignments, exercises, class discussions,
and exams is posted on Canvas. The calendar is subject to change.



<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing. A homework
time guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the homework process.

<p>

  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make vocabulary study cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a solution?
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
		      noted previously? 
  </ul>


<p>

<h3>Attendance and Class Engagement</h3>

  The purpose of class meetings is to help in the pursuit of understanding the course material
  through lectures by the instructor, group discussions, and in-class problem solving practice.

<p>
  
Class attendance is not required. There is no grade penalty for absence,
nor is there any grade bonus for attendance.

<p>
  
Class time is for engagement with the subject. Class attendance requires
presence of mind and willingness to interact and particpate in class
activities. In addition to mental focus and participation, class
meetings presume politeness and kindness towards all others present. If
you choose to attend class, please observe the following.
<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging and web surfing are rude behaviors that distract everyone
  from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the room once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>


<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<!--
<h3>Student Opinion Survey</h3>


Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey. More details TBA.
-->

<h3>Graded Work</h3>

<p>
  
Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights.

<p>
  
<table border=1 cellpadding=10>
  <tr>
    <th> Graded Item(s)</th>
    <th> Weight</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vocabulary and Facts</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Problem Solutions</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Exams</td>
    <td>50% total</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
    <td>Final Exam</td>
    <td>30%</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

<h3><b>Graded Homework Assignments</b></h3>

<b>Vocabulary and Facts</b> For each reading assignment, you
  will write out vocabulary terms and facts that appear for the first
  time in that section. The format you use is your choice. You can use
  notecards or lists. You can type or write by hand. A sample note-card
  format is posted on the course web page.

<p>

<b>Problem Solutions</b> Problem solution write-ups will be due
frequently. For each assignment, write solutions in narrative form
using one or more complete sentences. Show details of necessary
calculations. Show your understanding by using appropriate vocabulary
and citing appropriate facts. Writing must be sufficiently clear for
readability using the classroom projection system. Sample solution write-ups are posted on the
course web pages.

<p>
  
<b>Submitting Graded Homework Assignments</b>  You will submit your vocabulary and
  facts assignments and your problem solutions assignments by uploading
  image files to Canvas. The image files can be cell phone photos,
  scanner images, or pdf documents if you have typed your work.

<p>
  
Writing assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the scoring rubric for graded homework
    assignments.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Graded Homework Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Score</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and solutions to problems are fully
    prepared. Solutions are written using complete sentences. Photos or
    scanned images are clear enough for readability on the classroom
    projection system.  </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> One or more vocabulary notecards or written solutions are
    partially, but not fully, prepared OR some of the submission is not
   clear enough to be readable using the classroom
    projection system.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and written solutions are not prepared, or
    are unreadable, or not turned in before the deadline. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>
  
    <h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Exam Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary where prompted. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

</table>  

<p>
  
Note on scoring for final exams: final exams may be scored on a 2-point
rubric. On this scale, 2 points corresponds to 5 points in the table
above, 1 point corresponds to 2, 3, or 4 points in the table above, and
0 points corresponds to 0 or 1 point in the table above.

<h3>Missed Exams and Extra Credit</h3>

Missed exams may be excused if the exam is missed
due to an excused absence (see the previous section on attendance).  If a
exam absence is not excused, it receives a score of
zero. There are no extra credit or makeup assignments or exams.

<h3>Details of Grade Calculation</h3>

<i>Grading policies and procedures
are subject to adjustment at any time at the discretion of the
instructor.</i>

<p>
  
Each item of graded work receives a <i>raw point score</i>.  The
numerical grade, or simply the <i>score</i>, for an item of graded work
is the raw point score divided by the total number of possible points
for that item.
<pre>
               raw point score
   score =  ---------------------
            total possible points
</pre>
For example, if Joe Student has a raw point score of 18 on a quiz that has
20 total possible points, then Joe's grade for that quiz is 18/20 = .9
= 90%.  Most of the remainder of this document is devoted to the
procedure used to compute an overall cumulative average from the
individual graded items.

<h4>  Weighted Averages </h4>

The <b><i>weighted average</i></b> of a list of numbers 
<pre align>
   x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

with <b><i>weights</i></b> given by the list of nonnegative numbers
<pre>
   w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

not all of which are zero, is the quantity 
<pre>
   x<sub>1</sub>w<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>w<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub>w<sub>3</sub> + ... + x<sub>n</sub>w<sub>n</sub> 
   ------------------------------ .
      w<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub> + w<sub>3</sub> + ... + w<sub>n</sub>
</pre>

<h4>Example</h4>
Joe Student has test scores of 79%, 86%, and 73%.  The tests
have weights 25/100, 40/100, and 35/100, respectively.  The weighted
average of the three test scores is
<pre>
   (.79)(25/100) + (.86)(40/100) + (.73)(35/100)
   ---------------------------------------------  = .797 = 79.7%.
            25/100 + 40/100 + 35/100
</pre>
If the weights are changed to 1, 3, and 2, the new weighted average
becomes
<pre>
   (.79)(1) + (.86)(3) + (.73)(2)
   ------------------------------  = .805 = 80.5%.
             1 + 3 + 2 
</pre>


<p>

  <!--
<i>Note: grade dropping is only applied in courses that have a final exam.</i>
-->
  
<h4>Excused missed assignments</h4>

Missed assignments may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor. An excused graded item is dropped from your
grade record by resetting its weight to zero.

<p>

  There are no makeups for missed assignments or exams.

  <p>
  
<h4>Forgiveness of one low score</h4>

At the end of the semester, the grading software will automatically
drop one graded item (but not your final exam score) from your
cumulative average by resetting its weight to zero; the
grading software will determine which of your graded items to
drop by choosing the one that most increases your overall
cumulative average by dropping it. If there is no item that increases
your cumulative average by dropping it, then no dropping will occur.
  
  
<h4>Meaning of letter grades</h4>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for ``excellent'' and ``good'' (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your mastery of the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the ``standard 10 point scale'' (A for 90% and
above, B for 80% and above, C for 70% and above, etc.), but the scale
may be adjusted, at the discretion of the instructor, so that the
meanings of the letter grades fit the descriptions given in the previous
section. Pluses and minuses are used to distinguish between the low,
middle and high achievers within each letter grade category.
