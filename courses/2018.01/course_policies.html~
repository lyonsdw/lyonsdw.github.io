<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
  growth</b> through the <b>understanding and mastery of mathematical concepts</b>. Student learning objectives 
  include the following.
<ul>
<li><b>reading skills</b> 
<li><b>analysis and problem solving skills</b> 
<li><b>clear, concise communication skills</b>

</ul>

Achievement of course goals and learning objectives requires desire for learning, willingness
to work hard, time (at least two hours on homework outside of
class for each hour in class), and persistence.

<h3>Course Calendar</h3>

The calendar for graded assignments and exams is posted on Canvas. The
calendar is subject to change.

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is the most important part of the course because the process of
reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing is the only way to
achieve real understanding and skills. No one else can read, think, or
write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other people solve
problems and explain ideas in class or in a study group or in a tutoring
session, but that is no substitute homework.

<p>

The time expectation for homework is two hours outside of class for
every hour of class meeting time. Plan your homework time in your weekly
schedule.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the homework process.

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make vocabulary study cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a
		solution?
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
  </ul>
    <li><b>EVERY WEEK</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
		      noted previously? 
  </ul>
  </ul>

<h3>Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and mastery of
the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with the
subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect, politeness,
and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration for the
learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging and web surfing are rude behaviors that distract everyone
  from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the room once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>


<h3>Graded Work</h3>

<p>
  
Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights. Details and instructions are given in
the sections that follow.

  </table>

<h3>Reading Homework Assignments: Vocabulary and Facts</h3>

  For each reading assignment, you
  will write out vocabulary terms and facts that appear for the first
  time in that section. The format you use is your choice. You can use
  notecards or lists. You can type or write by hand. A sample note-card
  format is posted on the course web page.

<h3>Writing Homework Assignments: Problem Solutions</h3>

Problem solution write-ups will be due
frequently. For each assignment, write solutions in narrative form
using one or more complete sentences. Show details of necessary
calculations. Show your understanding by using appropriate vocabulary
and citing appropriate facts. Writing must be sufficiently clear for
readability using the classroom projection system. Sample solution write-ups are posted on the
course web pages.

<p>
  
  <h3>Reading and Writing Homework Assignment Submission Instructions</h3>

  You will submit your vocabulary and
  facts assignments and your problem solutions assignments by uploading
  image files to Canvas. The image files can be cell phone photos,
  scanner images, or pdf documents if you have typed your work.

<h3>Reading and Writing Homework Assignment Standards and Grading</h3>

  
Writing assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the scoring rubric for graded homework
    assignments.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Reading and Writing Homework Assignment Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Score</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and solutions to problems are fully
    prepared. Solutions are written using complete sentences. Photos or
    scanned images are clear enough for readability on the classroom
    projection system.  </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> One or more vocabulary notecards or written solutions are
    partially, but not fully, prepared OR some of the submission is not
   clear enough to be readable using the classroom
    projection system.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and written solutions are not prepared, or
    are unreadable, or not turned in before the deadline. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>
  
<h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Exam Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary where prompted. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

</table>  

<p>
  
Note on scoring for final exams: final exams may be scored on a 2-point
rubric. On this scale, 2 points corresponds to 5 points in the table
above, 1 point corresponds to 2, 3, or 4 points in the table above, and
0 points corresponds to 0 or 1 point in the table above.

<h3>Makeup Assignments, Makeup Exams, and Extra Credit</h3>

There are no makeup assignments, makeup exams, or extra credit
assignments. 

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. Some examples are sports team
events, music tours, illness or injury, and unsafe driving conditions. There is no
grade for attendance or participation, but it is expected that each
student will exercise good judgement for choosing to miss a class. 

<p>
Except for exam days, excuses for absences are not required. Absence
from an exam may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an exam absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your exam absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed exam, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed exam.
  </ul>

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<!--
<h3>Student Opinion Survey</h3>


Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey. More details TBA.
