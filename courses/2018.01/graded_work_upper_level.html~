<h3>Presentations</h3>

Class will be in the style of a seminar. This means that everyone
contributes by giving oral presentations to the whole group. Students
will take turns presenting solutions to problems in the text. The
problem you present is your choice, but if someone has already presented
the problem you prepared for presentation, you can only give your
presentation if it is different in a substantial way from the previous
presentations of the same solution. If your turn in the presentation
rotation comes up and someone has already presented the solution(s) you
have prepared, then you get to pick another problem on the spot. In this
case, the focus in now on the immediate, real-time problem solving
process.

<p>

  Presentations will be graded for preparedness and effort. You will not
  be penalized for mistakes, but you will be penalized if you have not put
  sufficient effort into preparing your solution. In the case that your
  presentation is improvisational (due to one or more people having presented
  the solution(s) you had previously prepared) you will not be graded
  for your preparation, but instead for your ability
  to apply appropriate material from the reading assignments to create
  strategies to achieve a solution to a new problem.

<p>

  The presentation roster and rotation will be known in advance of each class
  meeting. On the day that you are likely to give a presentation, you
  should have the visual part of your presentation prepared and ready to
  show at the time class begins. Here are some suggestions for several
  different ways to prepare the visual part of
  your presentation.
  <ul>
    <li>Write your presentation on the board before class begins.
      <li>Write your presentation on paper by hand in clear, dark handwriting
	with plenty of white space to project using the document camera.
	<li>Prepare your presentation in electronic form (for example,
	using powerpoint or some other software) to project using the
	classroom podium computer.
  </ul>

<p>

  Presentations will be graded according to the following rubrics.

<p>
  
    <table border=1 cellpadding=10>

    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> The problem solution was prepared in advance. The presenter clearly made
    an effort to check the solution for correctness, to use
    appropriate vocabulary and notation, and to organize the logical
    flow of the solution. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> The problem solution was not fully prepared. The presenter did
    not check the solution for correctness, was uncareful in the use of
    vocabulary or notation, or failed to organize the logical flow of
    the solution. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> The solution was completely unprepared, or was minimally
    prepared with little regard to correctness or to cohesiveness of
    logic and presentation. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

    from the assigned reading. </td>

    towards a solution is forthcoming. </td>

<h3>Written Problem Solutions</h3>

<p>

You will write a complete solution for each problem that you present in
class. If you had to do an improvised solution for your presentation
because your prepared problems were already presented by others, you may
choose to write a complete solution your original problem if you
prefer. The solution must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your written problem solution will be graded for correctness in the following ways:
for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct logical flow in your
argument; and for the correct final answer.

<p>

  Hard copies of written solutions are due no later than the beginning
  of class on the second class meeting after the day that you gave your
  oral presentation of the problem in class. (For example, of you give
  your oral presentation on a Wednesday, your written solution is due at
  the beginning of class the following Monday. If that Wednesday
  presentation was in the week before spring break, then your written
  presentation is due at the beginning of class the Monday after spring break.)

<p>

Sample written solutions are posted on the course web pages.  
Here is the grading rubric.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Written Solution Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is typed, is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary and notation.  </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No written solution is submitted, a solution is submitted by is
    not typed, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the solution
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

</table>  
  
<h3>Written Investigations</h3>  

Written investigations are essays. The minimum length is two pages and the
maximum length is five pages. Written investigations must be typed. The
scope of a written investigation should be more than a homework problem,
but focused enough for a two to five page discussion.

<p>

  Written investigations will be graded on a 10-point scale. Five of the
  ten points use the same rubric as for a problem solution above. The
  remaining five points are for essay structure and writing: there must
  be a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The flow of your
  argument must be clear. 

<p>

  Hard copies of written investigations are due at beginning
  of class on the dates indicated on the course calendar.
  
<p>

  Two sample written investigations are posted on the course web pages.

<h3>Final Exam</h3>  

The final exam will be an essay. You will have a choice of prompts. The
final exam will be open book and open notes. You may use a calculator
but you may not use any network-capable device.
