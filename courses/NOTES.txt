24 August 2017

This directory:
~/a/web/html/courses

web-posted course documents are in subdirectories labelled by semester

!!! DO NOT EDIT PRIMARY COURSE SYLLABI in semester subdirectories masXXX !!!

Primary course syllabi are maintained in course home directory:
~/a/teach/courses/course_name/20XX.XX

documents to be edited and maintained in this directory:
index.html
common_syllabus.html ("syllabus part 2")
lvc_official_statements.html ("syllabus part 3")

all other docs have home locations under ~/a/teach
edit and maintain them there, then copy or move appropriate pdf to
subdirectories here

just wrote a new script
~/a/web/courseswebsync
that will copy syllabi from home directories to web directory, then
rsync everything to servers
