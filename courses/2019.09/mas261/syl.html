<h3>Course Description</h3>

We extend the theory and applications of differentiation and
integration, developed in introductory calculus courses, to functions
involving more variables. 

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

MAS 112 or MAS 162, or permission by the instructor

<h3>Texts and Materials</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Schlicker et al., <i>Active Calculus--Multivariable</i>, 2018 edition
    <li>Lyons, <i>Linear Algebra Basics Supplementary Notes</i>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Problem List</h3>

<ul>
  <li>  Part 1. Introduction to multivariable functions
    <ul>
      <li>Chapter 1
	</ul>

  <li>  Part 2. Introduction to linear algebra
    <ul>
      <li>Supplementary Notes, Sections 2.1--2.4
      </ul>

  <li>  Part 3. Derivatives of multivariable functions
    <ul>
      <li>Chapter 2
      <li>Supplementary Notes, Section 2.5
	</ul>

  <li>  Part 4. Integrals of multivariable functions
    <ul>
      <li>Chapter 3
	</ul>

</ul>

Course reading assignments are the text sections listed above. The
amount of problem solving practice needed to achieve mastery varies by
individual. Here are two extremes, for problems in the textbook.

<ul>
<li><b>Maximum practice needed:</b> work every "Example", work all of the "Activity"
problems, and work all of the "Exercises" in each section
<li><b>Minimum practice needed:</b> work approximately every other problem in the "Exercises" at the end of each section
</ul>

You should work all of the exercises in the Supplementary Notes.
