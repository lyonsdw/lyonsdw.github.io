All homework after exam 2 (starting Thursday 11/7)
==================================================
Submit 2 "before" problems and 2 "after" problems for each homework
assignment.

"Before" problems are the same as they have been up to exam 2.

"After" problems can be any 2 problems of your choosing from the section
on the calendar for the previous class meeting. In particular, "after"
problems can now be interactive problems that check your answers. The
only stipulation is that you can't repeat your "before" problems. You'll
get the best practice if you pick two of the highest numbered problems
you can manage.

Example: For Thursday 11/7, turn in 4 problems
"before" = choose any two problems from 3.3
"after" = choose any two problems from 3.2
