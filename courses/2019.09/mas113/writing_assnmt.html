MAS 113 Math Thinking Fall 2019
Writing Assignments

Submit each assignment 2 ways: as a pdf or photograph to Canvas before
midnight before class, and as a hard copy at the beginning of class.

All writing assignments must be typewritten. All write-ups should be in
narrative form, using complete sentences. Writing assignments 1,2,3 will
be graded for writing quality, not just for correctness of final
answers. "In-between" assignments will be graded for completeness and
effort, not for correctness.
