<i>Course policies are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.</i>

<h3>Grading</h3>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights.  

<pre>
Homework/Quiz/Writing 2/9
Nonfinal Exams        4/9 
Final Exam            3/9  
</pre>

Letter grades are assigned based on your cumulative average and class
participation.  The lowest of your scores may be dropped from your cumulative
average if you show improvement on the final exam.  See the course web page for
more <a href="grading_details.html">details about grade calculation</a>, including
how low scores may be dropped.  

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing
solutions. A homework time management guideline is 2 hours outside of
class for each hour of class meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a
standard 3 credit course. Because you will spend twice as much time
reading, thinking, and writing outside of class as the time you will
spend in class, homework is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience.

<p>

<b><i>Recommendation</i></b>: Keep a notebook or binder for reading
notes, class notes, and homework solutions. Mark your questions clearly
and be sure to follow up until you gain understanding.

<h3>Writing Exercises and Assignments</h3>

In-class writing exercises are based on assigned reading, homework
problems, and class discussion. Some courses, including most upper level
mathematics classes, also have out-of-class writing assignments. 

<h3>Quizzes and Exams</h3>

Quiz and exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Quiz and exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  All solutions must be written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>

See the <a href="writing_solutions.pdf">Writing Solutions</a> document
for standards and examples.

<p>

No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams.  

<!--
<h3>Course Schedule</h3>

The schedule for homework, quizzes, and exams will be announced in class
or by email.
-->

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected.  Absences may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor.  If you must miss a class and wish to have the absence excused,
please give the instructor written notice, on paper or by email, as far as
possible in advance.  In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
is not possible, please send written notice as soon as you can.

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Disabilities Services</h3>

Please inform the instructor of any physical, medical, psychological, or
learning disability that impacts your attendance or requires accommodation.  You
will need to provide documentation of your disability or medical condition to
the Director of Disability Services in Humanities 4, 867-6071.
