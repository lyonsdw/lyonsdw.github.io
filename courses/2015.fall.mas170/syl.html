<h3>Course Description</h3>

This course is an introduction to elementary descriptive and inferential
statistics. We emphasize qualitative understanding and judgment in the use of
statistics, addressing questions such as when conclusions based on statistics
are justified or meaningful. Topics may include design of experiments,
descriptive statistics, correlation and regression, probability, sampling and
hypothesis testing.  

<h3>Course Goals and Learning Objectives</h3>

After completing this course, students who desire to learn, who work
hard, who spend at least two hours on homework outside of class for each
hour in class, and persist until they master each topic, will be able to
do the following.
<ul>
<li>Learn or recall statistical ideas in reading texts of an appropriate
difficulty level
<li>Communicate statistical ideas using clear written and oral
presentations
<li>Provide basic analysis and interpretation of statistics in the real
world
<li>Read and judge the quality of, and draw conclusions from, statistical
  experiments and analysis
  </ul>

The IDEA objectives focused on in this course are the following.
  <ul>
<li>Developing skill in expressing yourself orally or in writing
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
solving, and decisions)
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories
</ul>


<h3>Prerequisites and Requirements Met</h3>

There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra skills.  This course meets
the Liberal Studies Area 4 requirement of College's General Education Program.

<h3>Text and Materials</h3>

<ul>
<li>Freedman et al., <i>Statistics</i>, 4th edition

<li>Calculator for homework and exams.  Business and graphing calculators are
  allowed, but not required.
</ul>

<h3>Graded Work</h3>
Your grade will be calculated twice: first using the categories and weights listed
below; then again with all grades before 10/1 <b>dropped</b>. You will
automatically receive the <b>higher</b> of the two for your final course grade.

<pre>
Cumulative grade as of 10/1        25% 
Daily homework beginning 10/8      10%
Tests 2,3,4                        13% each
Final Exam                         26%
</pre>

<h3>Homework assignments beginning 10/8</h3>
Written solutions to Chapter Review problems will be collected as shown on the course
calendar. The purpose of homework is to gain understanding
of the material. Solutions will be graded for <b>completeness</b> but <b>not
for correctness</b>. You are encouraged to check your solutions using the
Instructor's Solutions Manual, available in the mathematics office
suite. You may use the solutions manual in the math office, but do not
remove it from the math office. Please replace the solutions manual in
the file holder box mounted on the wall next to Dr. Lyons' door, Lynch 283H.

<h3>Reading and Problem List</h3>
The problems listed below from problem sets A, B, C, etc are intended
to help you check your understanding of the reading. Working these problems
and checking your answers in the key in the back of the book are part of
the homework reading assignment. These problems will not be collected or
graded.

is not possible, please send written notice as soon as you can.

<h3>Late or Missed Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

<h3>Class Engagement</h3>

Class time is for engagement with the subject. In consideration of
learning and out of politeness to others, please be focused and present
of mind, and please observe the following.
<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>No earphones or earbuds or music playing in class.
<li>No cell phone use in class, including texting.
<li>No emailing or web surfing during class.
</ul>
In addition to focus and engagement with the subject, class meetings
presume politeness and kindness. Here is a statement from
the <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i> document from the Office of the
Associate Dean of Academic Affairs.

<p>

"LVC is a community of inclusive excellence.  We affirm the rights of all
persons to a superior educational experience that is characterized by
respect for and tolerance of others. As such, this class and all classes
at LVC, are places where our core values of inclusiveness, civility and
appreciation of difference are affirmed."


<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

  students with disabilities.]</i>
