<p>

Achievement of course goals requires the following of the individual
student.
<ul>
<li>desire for learning
<li>willingness to work hard
<li>time
<li>persistence
</ul>
Applying these to the best of one's ability leads to a joyful and rewarding learning
process. The lack of one or more obstructs fulfillment.

<i>Learning objectives</i> are "skills, competencies, and abilities
students demonstrate in the course, and what knowledge students acquire
in the course" (definition taken from <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i>
from the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs). Students who desire to learn, work hard, spend at least
two hours on homework outside of class for each hour in class, and
persist until they master each topic, will:
<ul>
<li>demonstrate ability to construct meaning and understanding by
  reading technical material;
<li>demonstrate skill in analytical thinking and problem solving;
<li>demonstrate skill in clear, concise communication (written, oral, or
  both); 
<li>and demonstrate mastery of the course material at a satisfactory
  (grade `C') level or higher.
</ul>

<i>Assessment</i> is the measurement of progress toward course goals and
student learning objectives,
followed by the use of such measurement to realize these goals and objectives more
effectively.
Some forms of assessment used in this course are
<ul>
<li> scores on course assignments,
<li> instructor comments (oral, written, or both),
<li> rubric-based analysis of student work, and
<li> a student opinion survey <a href="idea_details.html">(IDEA)</a>
</ul>
