<i>[The following is the official LVC policy statement regarding
  students with disabilities.]</i>

<p>

Individuals with disabilities are guaranteed certain protections and
rights of equal access to programs and activities under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008. Therefore, Lebanon Valley College
recognizes the responsibility of the college community to provide equal
educational access for otherwise qualified students with disabilities.

<p>

Any student who needs classroom or testing accommodations is invited to
present letters from the Center for Disability Resources, located in the
Lebergern Learning Commons on the ground floor of the Mund College
Center.
