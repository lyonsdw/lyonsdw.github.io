<p>

Achievement of course goals requires the following of the individual
student.
<ul>
<li>desire for learning
<li>willingness to work hard
<li>time
<li>persistence
</ul>
Applying these to the best of one's ability leads to a joyful and rewarding learning
process. The lack of one or more obstructs fulfillment.
