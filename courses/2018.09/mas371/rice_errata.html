p.105, Theorem A. The second sentence in the proof refers to a problem
at the end of the chapter. The problem number should be 76.

p.109, Exercise 17. There is an error in the answer key for part c. The
domain for f_{X|Y} should be |y|-1 <= x <= 1-|y|, and the domain for
f_{Y|X} should be |x|-1 <= y <= 1-|x|.
  
p.113, Exercise 61. There is an error in the answer key. The factor
preceeding f_{XY} should be 1/|bd|. The absolute value signs are not
optional. Note that this problem is the 2-variable version of problem
62 in Ch 2.
