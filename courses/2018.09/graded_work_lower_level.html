<h3>Homework Reading Assignments: Vocabulary and Facts</h3>

  For each reading assignment, you
  will write out vocabulary terms and facts that appear for the first
  time in that section. Use one or more complete sentences for each
  vocabulary term or fact. The format you use is your choice. You can use
  notecards or lists. You can type or write by hand. A sample note-card
  format is posted on the course web page.

<h3>Homework Writing Assignments: Problem Solutions</h3>

For each writing assignment, write solutions in narrative form
using one or more complete sentences. Show details of necessary
calculations. Show your understanding by using appropriate vocabulary
and citing appropriate facts. Writing must be sufficiently clear for
readability using the classroom projection system. Sample solution write-ups are posted on the
course web pages.

<p>
  
  <h3>Homework Assignment Submission Instructions</h3>

Submit Reading (vocabulary and facts) and Writing (problem solutions)
  assignments online on Canvas. Assignments are due before midnight on
  the date indicated on the Course Calendar on Part 1 of the Course Syllabus.
Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup assignments.

<p>

  The simplest homework submission method is to take photos on your
  phone: one photo for each page of written solutions, and possibly
  several photos for vocabulary lists or notecards. Another possibility
  is to use a scanner. Submit all the reading and writing assignment
  photos or scans as one packet using the Canvas phone app or using a computer to
  the Canvas web site.
  

<h3>Homework Standards and Grading</h3>

  
Homework assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the scoring rubric for graded homework
assignments.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Reading and Writing Homework Assignment Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Score</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and solutions to problems are fully
      prepared. Vocabulary terms, facts, and problem solutions are written using complete
      sentences. Submission is clear enough for readability on the classroom projection system.
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> One or more vocabulary notecards or written solutions are
    partially, but not fully, prepared OR some of the submission is not
   clear enough to be readable using the classroom
    projection system.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Vocabulary notecards and written solutions are not prepared, or
    are unreadable, or not turned in before the deadline. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

<h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Exam Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary where prompted. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

</table>  

<p>
  
Note on scoring for final exams: final exams may be scored on a 2-point
rubric. On this scale, 2 points corresponds to 5 points in the table
