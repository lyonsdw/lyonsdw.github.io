<pre>
Chapter 3
---------
p.34 Exercise 8. "...points lie a circle" should be "...points lie on a circle"

p.34 Exercise 9. "...angle pzr " should be "...angle pzq"

Chapter 4
---------
p.40 Definition of "invariant". The definition given in the book is
ambiguous about quantifiers. Here is a clarified version.

   Let (S,G) be a geometry. Let D be a set of figures from (S,G), that
   is, the members of D are subsets of S. Let T be a transformation from
   G. The set D is <b>T-invariant</b> if, for every member B of D, T(B)
   is also in D. A function f defined on D is called <b>T-invariant</b>
   if f(T(B))=f(B) for all B in D. D is called <b>G-invariant</b>, or
   simply <b>invariant</b> (when G is understood by context), if D is
   T-invariant for all T in G. Likewise a function f defined on D is
   called <b>G-invariant</b>, or simply <b>invariant</b>, if f is
   T-invariant for all T in G.

p.41 Example 2. "...distances from the vertexes of Delta to the origin"
should be "...distances from the vertices of Delta to the origin"

p.44 displayed equation, should read

  s - t = (p + q)/2 - (p + r)/2 = (q - r)/2

p.47 Exercise 4. The statement to be shown is ambiguous or maybe false,
depending on your reading. It should read "f(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4) = 1 if and
only if the directed line segment from z_1 to z_2 is parallel and in the
same direction as the directed line segment from z_3 to z_4" OR,
alternatively, "f(z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4) = +/- 1 if and only if the line
containing z_1,z_2 is parallel to the line containing z_3,z_4".

p.48 Exercise 8. "Prove that any two figures in a minimally invariant
set ..." should be "Prove that any two figures in a minimal invariant
set..."


p.48 Exercise 9. The symbol for the line is intended to be the lower
case Greek letter phi. It is incorrectly typeset using an "emptyset"
symbol.

Chapter 5
---------
p.58 Definition of cross ratio. The definition in the book does not say
whether z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3 must be distinct. There is also no consideration
for the point at infinity. We will need to deal with both of these
issues. Here is a more careful definition.

   Let z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3 be distinct complex numbers. The <b>cross
   ratio</b> of the ordered 4-tuple, denoted (z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3), is
   defined to be

     (*)   (z_0 - z_2)/(z_0 - z_3) * (z_1 - z_3)/(z_1 - z_2).

   [Beware of potential notation ambiguity! The notation for cross ratio
   is identical to the notation for an 4-tuple. A responsible writer
   will give a helpful comment when the meaning is not clear from
   context.] 

   We extend the cross ratio to 4 distinct points in the extended
   complex plane as follows. If z_k=infinity for one of the k's, the
   cross ratio is defined to be the limit of (*) as z goes to infinity,
   with z_k replaced by z in (*). This is the same cancelling the two
   factors in the expression (*) that contain z_k.

   Given distinct complex numbers z_1,z_2,z_3, we write (z,z_1,z_2,z_3)
   to denote the Mobius transformation Tz = (z,z_1,z_2,z_3) by using (*)
   above when z is not equal to z_1, z_2, or z_3, and define T(z_k) to
   be the limit of Tz as z goes to z_k, for k=1,2,3.

p.59, second Theorem. In the first line of the proof of this theorem,
the author refers, for the first time, to "the Euclidean circle or
straight line determined by the three points...". There is an issue
here: this remark implies both existence and uniqueness of a cline that
contains three given points. In the continuation of the proof, the
author gives an argument that establishes both existence and
uniqueness. However, the result is a little understated, and the
conclusion is slightly subtle. Here is a possible clarification and
improvement.

  Theorem (replacement for 2nd theorem on p.59). Let z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3 be
  distinct points in the extended complex plane. The cross ratio
  (z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3) is real if and only if the four points lie on a
  cline. Furthermore, there is a unique cline that contains
  z_1,z_2,z_3.

The all you need to do is add a line or two to the end of the proof that
is given in the text to prove the "Furthermore" statement.

p.63 Exercise 3. In the hint, use cross ratios, as suggested on
pp.58--59, not on p.60.

Chapter 8
---------
p.87 First sentence at the top of the page has a misstatement. The
phrase "in other words" implies that a (Mobius) transfromation T
leaves the unit circle invariant if and only if T is in the hyperbolic
group. This is false; for example, consider T(z) = 1/z. The statement is
easily repaired by replacing "leaves the unit circle invariant" by
"leaves the unit disk D invariant".

Chapter 9
---------
p.101 There's a typographical error in the middle of the page where a
square appears between "ad" and "bc". The symbol should be a minus sign.

p.102 Exercise 1. The parenthetical remark refers to page 97. It should
be page 95.

p.103 Exercise 10. There's a typographical error in the middle of the page where a
square appears between "ad" and "bc". The symbol should be a minus sign.

Chapter 10
----------
p.113 The hint for exercise 3 should refer to p.10, not p.12.

p.114 Exercise 6 is half obliterated. 

Chapter 11
----------
p.116 In the third sentence from the top, the symbol d is missing a
conjugation symbol.

p.116 Definition of great circle, etc. "a great circle is a circle C"
should be "a great circle is a cline C". "an elliptic straight line is"
should be "an elliptic straight line segment is".

p.124 Exercise 17, the answer given is ambiguous, is better stated as 
"A = 4*pi*(sin(R/2))^2" or "A=4*pi*sin^2(R/2)"

Chapter 12
----------
p.130 Exercise 1. Every occurrence of the sybols A_k (the name of the
geometry) should be changed to G_k (the name of the transformation group
of the geometry A_k).

p.130 Exercise 2. "...where R= sqrt{|k|}" should be "...where R=1 /
sqrt{|k|}".

Chapter 14
----------
p.155 Figure 14.6. In the figure on the left, labels g and e should be
switched.

p.158 Exercise 5. "...on page 153 from equation (*) on page 152" should
be "...on page 151 from equation (*) on page 150"

p.159 Exercise 9. "...show that pn = LM" should be "...show that pn=Lm"

Chapter 17
----------
p.206 Exercise 4(a). "(qr)^* = q^*r^*" should be "(qr)^* = r^*q^*"

p.207 Exercise 14. In the first sentence, r_1 and r_2 should be unit
quaternions.
