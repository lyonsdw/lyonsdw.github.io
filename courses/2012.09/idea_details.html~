The primary goal of the course is <b>intellectual growth</b> through
<ul>
<li>understanding course material,
<li>critical reading,
<li>analytical thinking, and
<li>clear, concise writing.
</ul>
Here are links to the course goals 
documents for General Education and the Department of
Mathematical Sciences.

</ul>


<p>

Achievement of course goals requires the following of the individual
student.
<ul>
<li>desire for learning
<li>willingness to work hard
<li>time
<li>persistence
</ul>
Applying these to the best of one's ability leads to a joyful and rewarding learning
process. The lack of one or more obstructs fulfillment.

<i>Assessment</i> is the measurement of progress toward course goals,
followed by the use of such measurement to realize course goals more
effectively.
Some forms of assessment are
<ul>
<li> scores on course assignments,
<li> instructor comments on written work, 
<li> rubric-based analysis of student work, and
<li> a student opinion survey.
</ul>
Further details on these methods can be found in the following list of
 documents and web resources.

<li> <a href="writing_solutions.pdf"><i>Writing Guidelines</i></a> 
<li> <a href="http://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics">Assessment rubrics</a> by the American Association of Colleges
and Universities (AACU)
<li> <a href="http://www.theideacenter.org/about">The Individual
Development and Educational Assessment Center</a> (IDEA)
</ul>
The IDEA opinion survey is based on a list of
twelve <a href="http://www.theideacenter.org/sites/default/files/DirectionsToFaculty.pdf">objectives</a>
(see p.2 of the linked document). Of the twelve, the three most
applicable are the following.
<ul>
<li>Gaining factual knowledge (terminology, classifications, methods,
 trends) 
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories 
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
 solving, and decisions) 
</ul>

<p>

All of these assessment measurements---grades, instructor comments, rubrics, and
IDEA surveys---are tools for improving achievement of course goals. 
Grades and instructor comments are most useful in conjunction with
regular, ongoing office hours conversations with the instructor. In
turn, the instructor uses student feedback from the IDEA survey and
office hours conversations to adjust course structures to be more
effective.
