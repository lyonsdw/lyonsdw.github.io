This document describes details of the procedure used to determine
cumulative average and letter grades.  Grading policies and procedures
are subject to adjustment at any time at the discretion of the
instructor.

<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>

Your semester grade is determined by two components: one is
<i>quantitative</i> and the other <i>qualitative</i>.  The quantitative
component is the cumulative weighted average of graded work items (such
as quizzes, writing assignments, and exams) that have numerical scores.  The
qualitative component is determined by participation and engagement.

<p>

Each item of graded work receives a <i>raw point score</i>.  The
numerical grade, or simply the <i>score</i>, for an item of graded work
is the raw point score divided by the total number of possible points
for that item.
<pre>
               raw point score
   score =  ---------------------
            total possible points
</pre>
For example, if Joe Student has a raw point score of 18 on a quiz that has
20 total possible points, then Joe's grade for that quiz is 18/20 = .9
= 90%.  Most of the remainder of this document is devoted to the
procedure used to compute an overall cumulative average from the
individual graded items.

<p>

The way in which class participation and attendance affect your semester
grade is described in the final section below.

<h3>  Weighted Averages </h3>

The <b><i>weighted average</i></b> of a list of numbers 
<pre align>
   x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

with <b><i>weights</i></b> given by the list of nonnegative numbers
<pre>
   w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

not all of which are zero, is the quantity 
<pre>
   x<sub>1</sub>w<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>w<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub>w<sub>3</sub> + ... + x<sub>n</sub>w<sub>n</sub> 
   ------------------------------ .
      w<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub> + w<sub>3</sub> + ... + w<sub>n</sub>
</pre>

<h4>Example</h4>
Joe Student has test scores of 79%, 86%, and 73%.  The tests
have weights 25/100, 40/100, and 35/100, respectively.  The weighted
average of the three test scores is
<pre>
   (.79)(25/100) + (.86)(40/100) + (.73)(35/100)
   ---------------------------------------------  = .797 = 79.7%.
            25/100 + 40/100 + 35/100
</pre>
If the weights are changed to 1, 3, and 2, the new weighted average
becomes
<pre>
   (.79)(1) + (.86)(3) + (.73)(2)
   ------------------------------  = .805 = 80.5%.
             1 + 3 + 2 
</pre>

<h3>Weights used in grading</h3>

The course policies document gives a list of weights used for groups of scores.
Here is an example.

<pre>
   Quizzes             10% total
   Nonfinal Exams      60% total
   Final Exam          30%
</pre>

The Quizzes total weight of 10% is divided equally among the
individual quizzes.  For example, if there were 8 quizzes, each
gets a weight of 1.25%.  Likewise, the Nonfinal Exam total weight of 60% is
divided equally among the nonfinal exams.  If there are 3 nonfinal
exams, each gets a weight of 20%.

<h3>Possible forgiveness of a low grade</h3>

Resetting a weight to zero and recalculating a cumulative grade average
may produce a higher cumulative average.  For example, suppose we have
three tests with grades 80/100, 90/100 and 10/100, with weights 1/3, 1/3
and 1/3.  The cumulative average of these three tests is 
<pre>
   (80/100)(1/3) + (90/100)(1/3) + (10/100)(1/3)
   ---------------------------------------------  = .6 = 60%.
                 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3
</pre>
If we reset the third weight to zero, the new cumulative average is
<pre>
   (80/100)(1/3) + (90/100)(1/3) + (10/100)(0)
   ---------------------------------------------  = .85 = 85%.
                 1/3 + 1/3 + 0
</pre>
From the student's point of view, the second cumulative average is a
dramatic improvement.  The act of recalculating a cumulative average
after resetting a weight to zero is called <i>dropping a grade</i>.

<p>

Of all your nonzero grades lower than your final exam grade, one may be
dropped.  After the final exam is given, the computer grading program
will automatically determine the highest possible cumulative average
that can be obtained by dropping one nonzero grade (which must be lower than
your final exam grade).  This is your final cumulative average.  Note
that this dropping procedure can only increase your cumulative average.

<p>

Note: grade dropping is only applied in courses that have a final exam.  

<h3>Meaning of letter grades</h3>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for ``excellent'' and ``good'' (letter grades A and B) are high.
<!--Some students experience a culture shock when they earn a C for
satisfactory work that may have earned a B or an A in secondary school. -->
In this course, your grade reflects your mastery of the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h3>Determination of letter grade</h3>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to letter
grades is based on the ``standard 10 point scale'' (A for 90% and above, B
for 80% and above, C for 70% and above, etc.), but the scale may be
adjusted, at the discretion of the instructor, so that the meanings of the
letter grades fit the descriptions given in the previous section.

<p>

Pluses and minuses are used to distinguish between the low, middle and
high achievers within each letter grade category.  This is where the
qualitative assessment of participation and engagement has an effect.
For example, there may be a group of students with final cumulative
averages in the high 80s.  A student in this group who showed consistent
effort in class and during office hours might receive a B+, while a
student never came to office hours, did not say much during class
discussions, and had several unexcused absences might earn a B.
