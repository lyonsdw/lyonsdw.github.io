The primary goal of the course is <b>intellectual adventure leading to
growth</b>.

<p>

Secondary course goals are the following.
<ul>
<li>understanding course material
<li>critical reading
<li>analytical thinking
<li>clear, concise writing
</ul>
Here are links to the course goals 
documents for General Education and the Department of
Mathematical Sciences.

</ul>


<p>

Achievement of course goals requires the following of the individual
student.
<ul>
<li>desire for learning
<li>willingness to work hard
<li>time
<li>persistence
</ul>
Applying these to the best of one's ability leads to a joyful and rewarding learning
process. The lack of one or more obstructs fulfillment.

<p>

<i>Assessment</i> is the measurement of progress toward course goals,
followed by the use of such measurement to realize course goals more
effectively.
The primary forms of assessment are
grades and instructor comments on course
assignments. The <a href="course_policies.html"><i>Course
Policies</i></a>, <a href="grading_details.html"><i>Grading
Details</i></a>, and <a href="writing_solutions.pdf"><i>Writing
Guidelines</i></a> documents provide a general discussion of grading
procedures. Specific grading criteria will be discussed for each
assignment.

<p>

In addition to grades and instructor comments, LVC measures progress
toward course goals using a student opinion survey conducted at the
end of each semester. The survey, a service
of <a href="http://www.theideacenter.org/about"><i>The Individual
Development and Educational Assessment Center</i></a> (called IDEA for
short) is based on a list of
twelve <a href="http://www.theideacenter.org/sites/default/files/DirectionsToFaculty.pdf">objectives</a>
(see p.2 of the linked document). Of the twelve, the three most
applicable are the following.

<ul>
<li>Gaining factual knowledge (terminology, classifications, methods,
 trends) 
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories 
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
 solving, and decisions) 
</ul>

<p>

All of these assessment measurements---grades, instructor comments, and
IDEA surveys---are tools for improving achievement of course goals. 
Grades and instructor comments are most useful in conjunction with
regular, ongoing office hours conversations with the instructor. In
turn, the instructor uses student feedback from the IDEA survey and
office hours conversations to adjust course structures to be more
effective.

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

A <i>learning outcome</i> is a goal whose achievement is expected. Because
achievement depends fundamentally on desire and work ethic, it follows
that learning outcomes vary among individuals. Learning outcomes for
this course constitute a full range, from low to high degree, of
progress toward course goals.
