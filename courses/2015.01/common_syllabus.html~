<i>Course policies are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.</i>

<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual growth</b> through
<ul>
<li>understanding mathematical concepts,
<li>analysis and problem solving, and
<li>clear, concise communication (for courses numbered 200 and higher).
</ul>

<p>

Achievement of course goals requires the following of the individual
student.
<ul>
<li>desire for learning
<li>willingness to work hard
<li>time
<li>persistence
</ul>
Applying these to the best of one's ability leads to a joyful and rewarding learning
process. The lack of one or more obstructs fulfillment.

<p>

<i>Learning objectives</i> (also called <i>student learning
  outcomes</i>) are "skills, competencies, and abilities
students demonstrate in the course, and what knowledge students acquire
in the course" (definition taken from <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i>
from the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs). Students who desire to learn, work hard, spend at least
two hours on homework outside of class for each hour in class, and
persist until they master each topic, will
<ul>
<li>demonstrate understanding of mathematical concepts,
<li>demonstrate skill in analysis and problem solving, and
<li>demonstrate skill in clear, concise communication (for courses numbered
  200 and higher), and
<li>demonstrate mastery of the course material at a satisfactory
  level (grade `C') or higher.
</ul>

<p>

<!--
<i>Assessment</i> is the measurement of progress toward course goals and
student learning objectives,
followed by the use of such measurement to realize these goals and objectives more
effectively.
Some forms of assessment used in this course are
<ul>
<li> scores on course assignments,
<li> instructor comments (oral, written, or both),
<li> rubric-based analysis of student work, and
<li> a student opinion survey (IDEA)</a>.
</ul>
-->

<h3>Course Schedule</h3>

The schedule for reading assignments, exercises, discussion, quizzes,
and exams, and other assignments is posted on a separate Course Calendar
on the course web pages. The schedule is subject to change.

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing. A homework
time guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience. 

<p>

The following are recommendations for managing homework
assignments.

<p>

<h4>Workflow for daily reading and exercises</h4>

<ul>

 <li> (BEFORE CLASS) Do a first reading and make a first attempt on the
assigned exercises for each section before the class date indicated on
the Course Schedule. Make notes about difficulties in the reading and
exercises. [<i>Recommendation</i>: Keep a separate notebook or binder
section for reading notes and exercise solutions.]
 
<li> (IN CLASS) Ask the questions you noted in the previous step.
 
<li> (AFTER CLASS) Do a second reading and second attempts at problems you
 did not finish in the "before class" step above. Repeat the
 read-exercise-ask cycle (continuing in office hours) until you have
 mastered the reading and problems in each section.

</ul>

<h4>Workflow for longer term assignments</h4>

<p>

Write a complete draft <b><i>before the due date</i></b>. This will tell
  you if you have gaps in understanding. Discuss these in class or in
  office hours, then revise your assignment before submission. Repeat
  the draft-discuss-revise cycle until your understanding and exposition
  are good.


<h3>Quizzes and Exams</h3>

Quiz and exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Quiz and exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. 

<p>

No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during quizzes and exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes and exams.

<!--
[Note: some courses do not
have a final exam.]


<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  All solutions must be written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>

See the <a href="writing_solutions.pdf">Writing Solutions</a> document
for standards and examples.

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected.  Absences may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor.  If you must miss a class and wish to have the absence excused,
please give the instructor written notice, on paper or by email, as far as
possible in advance.  In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
is not possible, please send written notice as soon as you can.

<h3>Class Engagement</h3>

Class time is for engagement with the subject. In consideration of
learning and out of politeness to others, please be focused and present
of mind, and please observe the following.
<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>No earphones or earbuds or music playing in class.
<li>No cell phone use in class, including texting.
<li>No emailing or web surfing during class.
</ul>

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

<i>[The following is the official LVC policy statement regarding
  students with disabilities.]</i>

<p>

"Individuals with disabilities are guaranteed certain protections and
rights of equal access to programs and activities under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008. Therefore, Lebanon Valley College
recognizes the responsibility of the college community to provide equal
educational access for otherwise qualified students with disabilities.

<p>

Any student who needs classroom or testing accommodations is invited to
present letters from the Center for Disability Resources, located in the
Lebergern Learning Commons on the ground floor of the Mund College
Center."

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>IDEA Survey</h3>

Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey called the Individual Development
and Educational Assessment ("the IDEA survey").
Of the twelve objectives on which it is based, the three most
applicable to this course are the following.
<ul>
<li>Gaining factual knowledge (terminology, classifications, methods,
 trends) 
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories 
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
 solving, and decisions) 
</ul>
