<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual growth</b> through
<ul>
<li>understanding mathematical concepts,
<li>analysis and problem solving, and
<li>clear, concise communication.
</ul>

<p>

Achievement of course goals requires the following of the individual
student.
<ul>
<li>desire for learning
<li>willingness to work hard
<li>time
<li>persistence
</ul>
Applying these to the best of one's ability leads to a joyful and rewarding learning
process. The lack of one or more obstructs fulfillment.

<p>

<i>Learning objectives</i> (also called <i>student learning
  outcomes</i>) are "skills, competencies, and abilities
students demonstrate in the course, and what knowledge students acquire
in the course" (definition taken from <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i>
from the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs). Students who desire to learn, work hard, spend at least
two hours on homework outside of class for each hour in class, and
persist until they master each topic, will
<ul>
<li>demonstrate understanding of mathematical concepts,
<li>demonstrate skill in analysis and problem solving, and
<li>demonstrate skill in clear, concise communication (for courses numbered
  200 and higher), and
<li>demonstrate mastery of the course material at a satisfactory
  level (grade `C') or higher.
</ul>

<p>

<!--
<i>Assessment</i> is the measurement of progress toward course goals and
student learning objectives,
followed by the use of such measurement to realize these goals and objectives more
effectively.
Some forms of assessment used in this course are
<ul>
<li> scores on course assignments,
<li> instructor comments (oral, written, or both),
<li> rubric-based analysis of student work, and
<li> a student opinion survey (IDEA)</a>.
</ul>
-->

<!--
<h3>Course Schedule</h3>

The schedule for reading assignments, exercises, discussion, quizzes,
and exams, and other assignments is posted on a separate Course Calendar
on the course web pages. The schedule is subject to change.
-->

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing. A homework
time guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience.

<p>

Here are details on homework assignments.

<p>

  <h4>Instructions for Daily Homework Assignments</h4>

For each class
meeting except for review and exam days, do the following.
<ul>
  <li><b>Read</b> the section(s) indicated on the Course Calendar in
  part 1 of the Course Syllabus.
    <li> <b>Identify</b> new terminology and new facts introduced in the
      reading.
      <li> <b>Write</b> definitions and statements of new terminolgy and
      new facts, and give an example for each one. Use complete
	sentences. This is called the <i>Reading Vocabulary</i> assignment.
	<li> <b>Solve</b> (or attempt to solve) the homework problems
	listed for the section(s) in the Reading and Problems list in
	part 1 of the Course Syllabus. Write these solutions using
	complete sentences. If you are unable to completely solve a
	problem, write an account of your partial progress, and
	articulate as clearly as possible the obstacle(s) that prevent
	  you from moving forward. This is called the <i>Problem
	Solutions</i> assignment.
	  <li> <b>Print</b> and fill out a copy of the daily homework
	    cover sheet.
	    <li> <b>Staple</b> together the cover sheet, the Reading
	      Vocabulary write-up, and the Problem Solutions.
	      <li> <b>Submit</b> the day's written homework assignment
	      packet at the beginning of class on the date indicated on
	      the Course Calendar.
</ul>

[<b>Note for MAS 261:</b> For days marked "Round 1" on the Course Calendar,
write solutions for the first 4 of the 6 problems listed for each
section. For days marked "Round 2", write solutions for the last 2 of
the 6 problems for each section, and omit the Reading Vocabulary
assignment because you have already done it for those sections. This
method works out to 8 problem solutions write ups for each class meeting.]


  <h4>Grading Scheme for Homework</h4>
  
Each daily written homework packet is scored on a scale of 0 to 2 points as
follows.

<ul>
<li> <b>2 points</b> Reading Vocabulary is complete and
  written in complete sentences. All Problem Solutions write-ups are
  either complete or end with an articulation of what is obstructing
  you. Mistakes and misconceptions do not count against you.
  <li> <b>1 point</b> One or more problem solution write-ups is missing
  or incomplete, or one or more key vocabulary, facts, or examples is
  missing or incomplete. "Incomplete" includes failure to use complete
    sentences.
    <li> <b>0 points</b> Several or more problem solutions or
    vocabulary, facts, and examples is missing or incomplete, or the
    work is sloppy or illegible. 
  </ul>

<p>
  
  <h4>Non-graded Homework Assignments</h4>

  Non-graded homework includes reading each assigned section, solving
  extra problems when you need more practice for complete
  understanding, and preparing for exams.

  <h4>Homework Recommendations</h4>

  <ul>
<li>Keep your class notes, reading notes, reading vocabulary and
  problem solutions in a binder organized by text section (not by
  date!).
  <li>Use bright sticky notes or to do lists or whatever method works
  for you to clearly mark reading and problem questions and stuck
  places. Ask questions, revisit the material (re-read the text and work more
    problems), and follow up until your understanding is resolved.
    <li>Consolidate your daily reading
  vocabulary homework into summary vocabulary and fact sheets or flash
  cards; this is an excellent study aid for exam preparation.
    </ul>

<h3>Exams</h3>

Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
time during final exams week.

<p>

No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during exams.


<p>

For full credit, exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
(labeled <b>DISCUSSION</b>) must be written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.


<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected.  Absences may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor.  If you must miss a class and wish to have the absence excused,
please give the instructor written notice, on paper or by email, as far as
possible in advance.  In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
is not possible, please send written notice as soon as you can.

<h3>Late or Missed Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

Late or missed assignments receive no credit. There are no extra
credit assignments.

<h3>Class Engagement</h3>

Class time is for engagement with the subject. In consideration of
learning and out of politeness to others, please be focused and present
of mind, and please observe the following.
<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>No earphones or earbuds or music playing in class.
<li>No cell phone use in class, including texting.
<li>No emailing or web surfing during class.
</ul>
In addition to focus and engagement with the subject, class meetings
presume politeness and kindness. Here is a statement from
the <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i> document from the Office of the
Associate Dean of Academic Affairs.

<p>

"LVC is a community of inclusive excellence.  We affirm the rights of all
persons to a superior educational experience that is characterized by
respect for and tolerance of others. As such, this class and all classes
at LVC, are places where our core values of inclusiveness, civility and
appreciation of difference are affirmed."


<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

<i>[The following is the official LVC policy statement regarding
  students with disabilities.]</i>

<p>

"Individuals with disabilities are guaranteed certain protections and
rights of equal access to programs and activities under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008. Therefore, Lebanon Valley College
recognizes the responsibility of the college community to provide equal
educational access for otherwise qualified students with disabilities.

<p>

Any student who needs classroom or testing accommodations is invited to
present letters from the Center for Disability Resources, located in the
Lebergern Learning Commons on the ground floor of the Mund College
Center."

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>IDEA Survey</h3>

Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey called the Individual Development
and Educational Assessment ("the IDEA survey").
Of the twelve objectives on which it is based, the three most
applicable to this course are the following.
<ul>
<li>Gaining factual knowledge (terminology, classifications, methods,
 trends) 
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories 
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
 solving, and decisions) 
</ul>
