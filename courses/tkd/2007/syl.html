<h3>What to Wear</h3>

Wear comfortable workout clothes that do not restrict your
movement. Please leave watches and jewelery in your dorm room or in a
gym bag.

<h3>Etiquette</h3>

Taekwondo is a martial art, and as such, has a code of etiquette for
behavior during training. Taekwondo is based on mutual respect among
fellow students and between teacher and student. In particular,
students are expected to follow the teacher's instructions, and to ask
permission when this is not possible. We do this not merely to follow
tradition, but also for safety.

Occasional course announcements will be made to your LVC email account.
