<h3>Course Description</h3>

Finite mathematics is an introduction to mathematical techniques used in
business, economics, and other areas.  Topics include financial
applications involving interest, linear systems of equations, matrices,
linear programming, and probability. The course begins with a review of
linear and exponential functions.

<h3>Prerequisites and Requirements Met</h3>

There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra skills.  This course meets
the Liberal Studies Area 4 requirement of College's General Education Program.

<h3>Text and Materials</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lial et al., <i>Finite Mathematics with Applications</i>, 11th
  edition
<li>Lyons, <i>Supplementary Course Notes</i>
<li>Calculator for homework and exams.  Business and graphing calculators are
  allowed, but not required.
</ul>

Course reading assignments are the text sections listed above. The
amount of problem solving practice needed to achieve mastery varies by
individual. Here are two extremes.

<ul>
<li><b>Maximum practice needed:</b> every other odd numbered problem in a section
<li><b>Minimum practice needed:</b> a sampling of one problem from each "block" of
similar problems. For example, in section 5.1, this is 1 problem from
each of 9 blocks 2--10, 11--16, 17--22, 23--26, 27--30, etc, 53--56.
</ul>
