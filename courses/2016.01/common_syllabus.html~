<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual growth</b> through
<ul>
<li>understanding mathematical concepts,
<li>analysis and problem solving, and
<li>clear, concise communication.
</ul>

<p>

Achievement of course goals requires the following of the individual
student.
<ul>
<li>desire for learning
<li>willingness to work hard
<li>time
<li>persistence
</ul>
Applying these to the best of one's ability leads to a joyful and rewarding learning
process. The lack of one or more obstructs fulfillment.

<p>

<i>Learning objectives</i> (also called <i>student learning
  outcomes</i>) are "skills, competencies, and abilities
students demonstrate in the course, and what knowledge students acquire
in the course" (definition taken from <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i>
from the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs). Students who desire to learn, work hard, spend at least
two hours on homework outside of class for each hour in class, and
persist until they master each topic, will
<ul>
<li>demonstrate understanding of mathematical concepts,
<li>demonstrate skill in analysis and problem solving, and
<li>demonstrate skill in clear, concise communication (for courses numbered
  200 and higher), and
<li>demonstrate mastery of the course material at a satisfactory
  level (grade `C') or higher.
</ul>

<p>

<!--
<i>Assessment</i> is the measurement of progress toward course goals and
student learning objectives,
followed by the use of such measurement to realize these goals and objectives more
effectively.
Some forms of assessment used in this course are
<ul>
<li> scores on course assignments,
<li> instructor comments (oral, written, or both),
<li> rubric-based analysis of student work, and
<li> a student opinion survey (IDEA)</a>.
</ul>


<h3>Course Schedule</h3>

The schedule for reading assignments, exercises, class discussions,
exams, and other assignments is posted on a separate Course Calendar on
the course web pages. The schedule is subject to change.
-->

<h3>Graded Work</h3>
<i>Note: Grading and other course policies are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.</i>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights.  

<pre>
In-class Practice and Quiz 15% total
3 in-class exams           60% total
Final Exam                 25%
</pre>


<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing. A homework
time guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience.

<p>

  <h4><b>Homework Recommendations</b></h4>

  <ul>
<li>Keep your class notes, reading notes, reading vocabulary and
  problem solutions in a binder organized by text section (not by
  date!).
  <li>Use sticky notes or to do lists or whatever method works
  for you to clearly mark reading and problem questions and stuck
  places. Ask questions, revisit the material (re-read the text and work more
    problems), and follow up until your understanding is resolved.
    <li>Consolidate your daily reading
  vocabulary homework into summary vocabulary and fact sheets or flash
  cards; this is an excellent study aid for exam preparation.
    </ul>

  <h3>In-class Practice</h3>

Class discussion will be integrated with practice through in-class
  exercises, conducted and collected each class 
  meeting. Solutions will earn full credit for making a complete effort,
  but will not be graded for correctness.

  <h3>Quizzes and Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
  To practice writing exam-style solutions and to provide incentive for
  thorough work on assigned homework problems, one to several in-class
  quiz problems will be conducted, collected,
  and graded each week. Quiz problems will be identical to or a slight
  variation of previously assigned homework problems (see the Homework Reading
  and Problem list on Part 1 of the Course Syllabus) from a section of
  the textbook shown on the course calendar 2 or more class meetings
  prior to the class meeting on which the quiz is given. Quizzes may be
  given during any class meeting with no previous notice.
  
<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during quizzes or exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>

Quiz and exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Score</b></td>
    <td> <b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary where prompted. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

</table>  


<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected.  Absences may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor. Here is the procedure to follow if you wish to have an
absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed class day, with a complete
  explanation for having to miss class.
  <li>Submit, via email attachment, a photo or scan of your written homework
solutions for all assigned homework problems for the text section
appearing on the course calendar two class meetings prior to the missed
class day. This is due before the end of the day before the missed
    class. One or more of your written homework solutions will be graded to take the
    place of the missed quiz.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send email notice and submit your
      written homework solutions (as described in the previous bullet
      point) as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice and written homework submission is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed class.
  </ul>

<h3>Late or Missed Assignments and Extra Credit</h3>

Late or missed assignments receive no credit. There are no extra
credit assignments.

<h3>Class Engagement</h3>

Class time is for engagement with the subject. In consideration of
learning and out of politeness to others, please be focused and present
of mind, and please observe the following.
<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>No earphones or earbuds or music playing in class.
<li>No cell phone use in class, including texting.
<li>No emailing or web surfing during class.
</ul>
In addition to focus and engagement with the subject, class meetings
presume politeness and kindness. Here is a statement from
the <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i> document from the Office of the
Associate Dean of Academic Affairs.

<p>

"LVC is a community of inclusive excellence.  We affirm the rights of all
persons to a superior educational experience that is characterized by
respect for and tolerance of others. As such, this class and all classes
at LVC, are places where our core values of inclusiveness, civility and
appreciation of difference are affirmed."


<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

<i>[The following is the official LVC policy statement regarding
  students with disabilities.]</i>

<p>

"Individuals with disabilities are guaranteed certain protections and
rights of equal access to programs and activities under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008. Therefore, Lebanon Valley College
recognizes the responsibility of the college community to provide equal
educational access for otherwise qualified students with disabilities.

<p>

Any student who needs classroom or testing accommodations is invited to
present letters from the Center for Disability Resources, located in the
Lebergern Learning Commons on the ground floor of the Mund College
Center."

<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>IDEA Survey</h3>

Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey called the Individual Development
and Educational Assessment ("the IDEA survey").
Of the twelve objectives on which it is based, the three most
applicable to this course are the following.
<ul>
<li>Gaining factual knowledge (terminology, classifications, methods,
 trends) 
<li>Learning fundamental principles, generalizations, or theories 
<li>Learning to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem
 solving, and decisions) 
</ul>
