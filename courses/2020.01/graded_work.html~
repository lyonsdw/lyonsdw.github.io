<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading course material and solving problems. Each graded daily
homework assignment is to show evidence of progress by submitting
written solutions for at least two problems.
Daily homework submissions are due before midnight on
  <i>the day before</i> every class meeting except for days marked
  "Review", "Exam", and "Workshop" on the Course Calendar.  You may choose any problems you prefer from
  the sections listed on the Course Calendar for the <i>next</i> class
  meeting after the homework is due.

<p>
  
  <h4>Homework Assignment Submission Instructions</h4>

Submit homework
  assignments online on Canvas. All solutions must be written using one
  or more complete sentences. Homework may be typed or written by hand.
Work is not accepted late. There are no makeup assignments.

<p>

  The simplest homework submission method is to take photos on your
  phone---one photo for each page of written solutions. Another possibility
  is to use a scanner. Submit all the homework assignment
  photos or scans as one packet using the Canvas phone app or to 
  the Canvas web site using a computer.

<h4>Homework Standards and Grading</h4>

  Homework assignments will be graded for preparation and completeness,
    not for correctness. Here is the scoring rubric for graded homework
assignments.

<p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Homework Assignment Scoring Rubric</th>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Score</b></th>
    <th> Description</b></th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Solutions to problems are fully
      prepared. Solutions are written using complete
      sentences. Submission is clear enough for readability on the classroom projection system.
    </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> One or more solutions are not complete OR some of the submission is not
   clear enough to be readable using the classroom
    projection system.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Written solutions are not prepared, or
    are unreadable, or not turned in before the deadline. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>
Writing assignments must be typed and must use appropriate mathematical
symbols. Handwritten solutions will not be
accepted. Your writing assignment will be graded for correctness in the following ways:
for correct use of vocabulary and notation; for correct logical flow in your
argument; and for the correct final conclusion(s).

<p>

  Hard copies of writing assignments are due no later than the beginning
  of class on the due dates indicated on the course calendar.

<p>

Sample writing assignments are posted on the course web pages.  
Here is the grading rubric.

  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>

      </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> The writing assignment is typed, is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary and notation.  </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> The writing assignment has a small flaw (for example, incorrect
    use of vocabulary, notation, or an error in calculation). The
    writing assignment
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> The writing assignment has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    problem right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No writing assignment is submitted, a writing assignment is submitted but is
    not typed, or claims are made with no supporting justification, or
    the writing assignment shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

<h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

    vocabulary where prompted. </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>

    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
