<i>Note: Course policies are subject to change at the
  discretion of the instructor.</i>

<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
  growth</b> through the <b>understanding and mastery of mathematical concepts</b>. Student learning objectives 
  include the following.
<ul>
<li><b>reading skills</b> 
<li><b>analysis and problem solving skills</b> 
<li><b>clear, concise communication skills</b>

</ul>

Achievement of course goals and learning objectives requires desire for learning, willingness
to work hard, time (at least two hours on homework outside of
class for each hour in class), and persistence.

<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is the most important part of the course because the process of
reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing is the only way to
achieve real understanding and skills. No one else can read, think, or
write for you. It can be very helpful to watch other people solve
problems and explain ideas in class or in a study group or in a tutoring
session, but that is no substitute for homework that you do yourself.

<p>

The time expectation for homework is two hours outside of class for
every hour of class meeting time. Plan your homework time in your weekly
schedule. 

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience. Here is an outline of the homework process.

<p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>BEFORE each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make vocabulary study cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a
		solution?
  </ul>
    <li><b>AFTER each class meeting</b>
  <ul>
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
  </ul>
    <li><b>EVERY WEEK</b>
  <ul>		      
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
			noted previously?
			<li><b>Follow up</b> on any questions or gaps
			that remain.
  </ul>
  </ul>

<h3>Class Engagement</h3>
  
The purpose of class meetings is to pursue understanding and mastery of
the course material. This requires mental presence, engagement with the
subject, and participation. Class meetings presume respect, politeness,
and kindness among all those in attendance. In consideration for the
learning environment, please observe the following.

<ul>
<li>No food in class.
<li>Use electronic devices only for engaging with the course
  material. For example, note-taking, calculating, and looking up facts
  related to the class discussion are positive activities; text
  messaging and web surfing are rude behaviors that distract everyone
  from focusing.
  <li>Except for emergencies, please do not leave the room once class
  begins. If you need to leave before the end of class, please inform
  the instructor before class begins.
</ul>

<h3>Makeup Assignments, Makeup Exams, and Extra Credit</h3>

There are no makeup assignments, makeup exams, or extra credit
assignments. 

<h3>Attendance</h3>

Class attendance is expected, but it is understood that sometimes there
are reasonable circumstances for absence. Some examples are sports team
events, music tours, illness or injury, and unsafe driving conditions. There is no
grade for attendance or participation, but it is expected that each
student will exercise good judgment for choosing to miss a class. 

<p>

  Except for exam days, excuses for absences are not required. Absence
from an exam may be excused, at the discretion of the instructor, for
certain events planned in advance or for emergency or illness. Here is
the procedure to follow if you wish to have an exam absence excused.
<ul>
<li>Send the instructor email notice of your exam absence as far as
  possible in advance of the missed exam, with a complete
  explanation for the purpose of your conflicting event.
    <li>In the case of illness or emergency where advance notice
      is not possible, send an email message as soon as it is practically possible. Collect
      documentation (doctor's notes, etc) to present to the instructor
      when you return to class. Except for extreme circumstances, your
      email notice is due by 5pm on the
      day of the missed exam.
</ul>

<p>

Absence does not change the due date for any graded work. 

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.


<h3>Email</h3>

Some course announcements will be sent to your LVC email account.

<h3>Gradebook</h3>

Please <b>ignore the averages and grades calculated by Canvas</b>; the
gradebook calculations in Canvas are not your actual course cumulative
average and grade. The only reason you can see the Canvas gradebook is
because it is impossible to turn off. The gradebook in Canvas is not used in this
course because it is not flexible enough to implement the course policy
that allows for the possible dropping of one grade (see Syllabus part
5). <b>You will receive your actual grade record in regular email grade
update reports</b> from the instructor.

<!--
<h3>Student Opinion Survey</h3>


Near the end of the course, you will be asked to complete an opinion
survey. More details TBA.
