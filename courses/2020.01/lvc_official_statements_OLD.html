<i>The following are official statements from the office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs.</i>

<h3>Inclusive Excellence</h3>

"LVC is a community of inclusive excellence.  We affirm the rights of all
persons to a superior educational experience that is characterized by
respect for and tolerance of others. As such, this class and all classes
at LVC, are places where our core values of inclusiveness, civility and
appreciation of difference are affirmed."

<h3>Title IX</h3>
  
"Lebanon Valley College prohibits discrimination on the basis of race,
color, national origin, ancestry, religion/creed, sex, pregnancy, sexual
orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, genetic
information, marital/familial status, or veteran status in all programs
and activities, as required by Title IX of the Educational Amendments of
1972, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
and other applicable statutes and/or College policies.

<p>
  
Title IX makes it clear that violence, harassment, and any type of
sexual misconduct based on sex and gender are civil rights
violations. If you or someone you know has experienced violence,
discrimination, or harassment, support is available through Counseling
Services, Health Service, the Chaplain’s office, the Victim Advocacy
Program, and Title IX deputies.  Please refer to the Student Handbook
for specific contact information."


<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>

"Any student who submits plagiarized work will be subject to the
penalties described in the Student Handbook and outlined in LVC’s
“Academic Honesty Policy”
(http://www.lvc.edu/catalog/acad-reg-procedures.aspx).
This code asks each student to do his/her own work in
his/her own words. A student shall neither hinder nor unfairly assist
the efforts of other students to complete their work. All individual
work that a student produces and submits as a course assignment must be
the student’s own. Cheating and plagiarism are acts of academic
dishonesty. Cheating is an act that deceives or defrauds. It includes,
but is not limited to, looking at another’s exam or quiz, using
unauthorized materials during an exam or quiz, colluding on assignments
without the permission or knowledge of the instructor, and furnishing
false information for the purpose of receiving special consideration,
such as postponement of an exam, essay, quiz or deadline of an oral
presentation. Plagiarism is the act of submitting as one’s own the work
(the words, ideas, images, or compositions) of another person or persons
without accurate attribution. Plagiarism can manifest itself in various
ways: it can arise from sloppy note-taking; it can emerge as the
incomplete or incompetent citation of resources; it can take the form of
the wholesale submission of other people’s work as one’s own, whether
from an online, oral or printed source. Students who take part in
violations such as cheating or plagiarism are subject to a meeting with
the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, who has the authority to take
further action, up to and including expulsion from the College."

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>


"Individuals with disabilities are guaranteed certain protections and
rights of equal access to programs and activities under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act
Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008. Therefore, Lebanon Valley College
recognizes the responsibility of the college community to provide equal
educational access for otherwise qualified students with disabilities.

<p>

Any student who needs classroom or testing accommodations is invited to
present letters from the Center for Accessibility Resources and discuss
accommodations with me after class or during office hours. The Center
for Accessibility Resources is located in the Lebegern Learning Commons in
Mund Suite 002. Students may schedule an appointment by calling 717-867-6028."

<h3>Student Success Intervention Team</h3>

"At Lebanon Valley College, we want you to succeed in and out of the
classroom. Administrators and faculty work together to ensure not only
academic success but a highly-productive and positive four-year
experience. Students who are not performing to their potential can be
referred to the Student Success Intervention Team (Early Alert
Committee), which is a group of individuals from Student Affairs,
Academic Affairs, and Enrollment Management. This group will guide you
through any difficult situation, whether academic or personal.  You
should, consider it your assignment to follow through and accept
assistance from the appropriate source(s). Don’t be afraid or hesitant
to seek help from these individuals: supporting you is their job! Be
proactive and take control of your success. Visit this page for Help at
LVC: http://www.lvc.edu/student-affairs/help.aspx."

<h3>Course Evaluation using EvaluationKIT</h3>

"As part of our commitment to providing you with a quality education, you
will be offered the opportunity, toward the end of the semester, to
evaluate aspects of this course.  LVC uses a standardized evaluation
through EvaluationKIT.  During the last few weeks of class, you will
receive an [e]mail and/or Canvas notification to complete an on-line
evaluation of each of your courses.  Questions will range from general
impressions of the course and instructor to assessing more specific
learning gains as a result of participating in a course. We need your
feedback!  We ask that you complete these course evaluations in a timely
manner; all responses are anonymous and instructors will only be able to
review the results after all grades are submitted.  You have the ability
to help us provide you with the best learning experience possible; we
value your input. [I]t does make a difference."
