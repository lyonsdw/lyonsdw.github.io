    <h2>MAS 170 Spring 2020 Final Exam Study</h2>

    Study strategy for the final exam is the same as for every other
    exam---the only difference is that there is more material on the final 
    exam. Study breaks into two main parts.

    <h3>1. Vocabulary and facts</h3>

    Make index cards or two-column
    sheets or use some electronic method to make an entry for every
    vocabulary term, fact, and formula. The front of the card should be
    the term or the name of the fact or formula, and the back should
    have the definition or statement (best to use one or more complete
      sentences, not sentence fragments) along with an example. See the
    course web page for sample vocabulary cards.

    <p>

      If you've been making vocabulary cards all along, just gather them
      up into one pile for final exam study. If you are behind in making
      your cards, now is the time to start.

    <p>

     To make sure you are not missing important vocabulary, use the
     end-of-chapter summaries in the text, and use the Summary Notes on
     the course web page.

     <h3>2. Solve problems</h3>

	 Make a list of problem types
         from each chapter. For a guide, use the Summary Notes on the
         course web page, and review our previous exams (links are
         below). Find an example of each problem type in the text, and
         work a problem of that type yourself. Make sure you check the
         solution. Keep a list of problems that you are having trouble
         with and follow up in email or in an office hour video meeting.

	 <h3>In general</h3>

	  Don't get stuck! Do just a few problems in each chapter, and
	  keep moving. Go from the start to the finish of the semester
	  material. Then repeat the cycle. Rehearse your vocabulary
	  cards every day until you can say them in your sleep. Allot 2
	  hours each day for final exam study.
