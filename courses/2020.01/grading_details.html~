<i>Grading policies and procedures
are subject to adjustment at any time at the discretion of the
instructor.</i>

<p>
  
Each item of graded work receives a <i>raw point score</i>.  The
numerical grade, or simply the <i>score</i>, for an item of graded work
is the raw point score divided by the total number of possible points
for that item.
<pre>
               raw point score
   score =  ---------------------
            total possible points
</pre>
For example, if Joe Student has a raw point score of 18 on a quiz that has
20 total possible points, then Joe's grade for that quiz is 18/20 = .9
= 90%.  Most of the remainder of this document is devoted to the
procedure used to compute an overall cumulative average from the
individual graded items.

<h4>  Weighted Averages </h4>

The <b><i>weighted average</i></b> of a list of numbers 
<pre align>
   x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

with <b><i>weights</i></b> given by the list of nonnegative numbers
<pre>
   w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub> 
</pre>

not all of which are zero, is the quantity 
<pre>
   x<sub>1</sub>w<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>w<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub>w<sub>3</sub> + ... + x<sub>n</sub>w<sub>n</sub> 
   ------------------------------ .
      w<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub> + w<sub>3</sub> + ... + w<sub>n</sub>
</pre>

<h4>Example</h4>
Joe Student has test scores of 79%, 86%, and 73%.  The tests
have weights 25/100, 40/100, and 35/100, respectively.  The weighted
average of the three test scores is
<pre>
   (.79)(25/100) + (.86)(40/100) + (.73)(35/100)
   ---------------------------------------------  = .797 = 79.7%.
            25/100 + 40/100 + 35/100
</pre>
If the weights are changed to 1, 3, and 2, the new weighted average
becomes
<pre>
   (.79)(1) + (.86)(3) + (.73)(2)
   ------------------------------  = .805 = 80.5%.
             1 + 3 + 2 
</pre>


<p>



<h4>Excused missed assignments or exams</h4>
  
Missed assignments or exams may be excused, at the discretion of the
instructor. An excused graded item is dropped from your grade record by
resetting its weight to zero. 

<p>

If a missed assignment or exam is not excused, it receives a score of
zero. 

  
<h4>Forgiveness of one low score</h4>

At the end of the semester, the grading software will automatically
drop one graded item (but not your final exam score) from your
cumulative average by resetting its weight to zero; the
grading software will determine which of your graded items to
drop by choosing the one that most increases your overall
cumulative average by dropping it. If there is no item that increases
your cumulative average by dropping it, then no dropping will occur.

<p>
  
<i>Note: grade dropping is only applied in courses that have a final
  exam.</i>

<h4>Meaning of letter grades</h4>

According to the College Catalog, letter grades have the following
meanings.

<pre>
   Letter Grade     Meaning
   ------------     ------
        A           excellent
        B           good
        C           satisfactory
        D           requirements and standards met at a minimum level
        F           course requirements not met
</pre>

Standards for ``excellent'' and ``good'' (letter grades A and B) are high.
In this course, your grade reflects your mastery of the material.  A good
grade is not guaranteed by class attendance and performing the motions of
homework; to earn an A or a B, you must demonstrate understanding that
transcends mere rote familiarity.

<h4>Determination of letter grade</h4>

At the end of the semester, your final cumulative average is used to
assign a letter grade.  The scale used to convert cumulative averages to
letter grades is based on the ``standard 10 point scale'' (A-,A,A+ for
90 to 100 percent range, B-,B,B+ for percentages in the 80's, C-,C,C+
for the 70's, etc.), but the scale may be adjusted, at the discretion of
the instructor, so that the meanings of the letter grades fit the
descriptions given in the previous section. Pluses and minuses are used
to distinguish between the low, middle and high achievers within each
letter grade category.

<p>
<i>Note on mid-term grades:</i> Pluses and minuses are not used for
midterm grades.
