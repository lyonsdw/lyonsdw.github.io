<h3>Course Goals</h3>

The primary goal of the course is <b>mathematical intellectual
  growth</b>. This involves understanding mathematical concepts,
  analysis and problem solving, and clear, concise communication.
Achievement of course goals requires desire for learning, willingness to
  work hard, time, and persistence.

<p>

<i>Learning objectives</i> (also called <i>student learning
  outcomes</i>) are "skills, competencies, and abilities
students demonstrate in the course, and what knowledge students acquire
in the course" (definition taken from <i>Elements of Course Syllabi</i>
from the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs). Students who desire to learn, work hard, spend at least
two hours on homework outside of class for each hour in class, and
persist until they master each topic, will
<ul>
<li>demonstrate <b>understanding of mathematical concepts</b>,
<li>demonstrate skill in <b>analysis and problem solving</b>, and
<li>demonstrate skill in <b>clear, concise communication</b> (for courses numbered
  200 and higher), and
<li>demonstrate <b>mastery of the course material</b> at a satisfactory
  level (grade `C') or higher.
</ul>

<p>

<!--
<i>Assessment</i> is the measurement of progress toward course goals and
student learning objectives,
followed by the use of such measurement to realize these goals and objectives more
effectively.
Some forms of assessment used in this course are
<ul>
<li> scores on course assignments,
<li> instructor comments (oral, written, or both),
<li> rubric-based analysis of student work, and
<li> a student opinion survey (IDEA)</a>.
</ul>


<h3>Course Schedule</h3>

The schedule for reading assignments, exercises, class discussions,
exams, and other assignments is posted on a separate Course Calendar on
the course web pages. The schedule is subject to change.
-->

<h3>Graded Work</h3>
<i>Note: Grading and other course policies are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.</i>

Your cumulative average is determined by graded work in the categories listed
below with the indicated weights.  

<pre>
Solution presentations   10% total
3 in-class exams         60% total
Final Exam               30%
</pre>


<h3>Homework</h3>

Homework is reading, thinking, solving problems, and writing. A homework
time guideline is 2 hours outside of class for each hour of class
meeting time, or 6 hours per week for a standard 3 credit
course. Because you will spend twice as much time reading, thinking, and
writing outside of class as the time you will spend in class, homework
is the most important part of the course.

<p>

The quality of your homework translates directly into success.  Low effort or
too little time spent on homework guarantees lack of success in the course;
consistent high quality homework guarantees a positive learning
experience.

<p>

  <h4><b>Homework Instructions</b></h4>

  <ul>
	<li><b>Read</b> the text section(s) indicated on
	  the course calendar.
	  <li><b>Write</b> vocabulary and facts from the new text
	    section. Make lists or note cards.
	    <li><b>Solve</b> at least a few of the low numbered problems
	      from the new text section.
	      <li><b>Note</b> your questions, problems, and
	      difficulties. In the reading, where, precisely, do you
	      have trouble understanding? With the problems, what,
		precisely, is obstructing you from completing a solution?
		<li><b>Reread</b> text sections listed for previous
		  class meetings.
		  <li><b>Solve more</b> problems. Complete the list of
		  homework problems from text sections for previous
		    class days. Prepare complete written solutions,
		  using complete sentences.
		    <li><b>Revise</b> and update your vocabulary and
		    fact lists or note cards after a second round with
		      each section of text.
		      <li><b>Assess</b> your progress and mastery. Have
		      you addressed all the questions and difficulties
		      noted previously? 
  </ul>
  

  <h3>Solution presentations</h3>

  Class discussion will include student presentations of
  solutions to homework problems from the text and supplementary
  problems given in class. Presentations will be graded
  for preparation and completeness, not for correctness.

<p>

 <h4> <b>Guidelines for presented solutions</b></h4>
  <ul>
<li>Write solutions in narrative form using one or more complete
  sentences.
  <li>Show details of necessary calculations. Show your understanding by
    using appropriate vocabulary and citing appropriate facts.
    <li>Calculus 3 problem sets at the end of each text section are
    divided into subsections called "Exercises", "Problems", and
    "Strengthen your Understanding". Eligible problems for presentation
    are all problems in the "Problems" subsection.
     <li>Eligible problems for presentation in Elementary Statistics are
     all problems in the Review Exercises at the end of each
     chapter.
    </ul>

<p>
  
  Here is the
  grading rubric for solutions presentations.

<p>
  
    <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Score</b></td>
    <td> <b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Solution was fully prepared in advance, ready for projection
    using a document camera or computer. Solution is written using
    complete sentences. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 points</td>
    <td> Solution is partially, but not fully, prepared. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> Solution is not prepared, or student is absent. </td>
    </td>
</tr>

</table>


  <h3>Exams</h3>  

  Exam problems are based on, but not limited to, the assigned
reading and exercises.  Exam format, subject matter, and rules
will be announced in advance.  The final exam will be comprehensive,
including material from the entire course. In keeping with College
policy, the final exam can only be taken at the officially scheduled
  time during final exams week.

<p>
  
No music players or electronics with wireless or network capabilities
(computers, phones, etc.) are allowed during quizzes or exams. No hats
with brims are allowed during quizzes or exams. If you need to leave the
classroom during an exam, you must leave your cell phone at the
instructor's desk in the front of the room.

<p>

For full credit, quiz and exam solutions must show not just final
results, but also demonstrate with appropriate supporting work that you
understand the reasoning involved.  Solutions to some problems
require responses written using
one or more complete sentences.  Solutions will be graded not only for
mathematical correctness, but for clarity of writing.  Illegible work or
a final answer given without supporting work shown receives no credit.

<p>
  
Exam problem solutions will be graded
using the following 5-point rubric. Exceptions will be announced in
advance.

<p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=10>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Score</b></td>
    <td> <b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 5 points</td>
    <td> Solution is complete and correct, shows appropriate work, and uses correct
    vocabulary where prompted. </td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 4 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a small flaw (for example, there's a correct solution method,
    but an arithmetic error throws off the final answer). Solution
    shows understanding of method(s) and issues involved.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 3 points</td>
    <td> Solution has a "medium" flaw (too large to be "small"), or several small flaws.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 2 points</td>
    <td> Response shows a start on the right direction, or has some part of the
    solution right, but largely goes wrong---too much wrong to earn 3 points.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 1 point</td>
    <td> There is some attempt at the problem; there is plausible
    evidence that some aspect of
    the problem is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    <td> 0 points</td>
    <td> No points are given for a blank response, an illegible
    response, or a final answer (say, for
    a computation) given with no supporting work shown, or if the response
    shows no plausible evidence that some key aspect of the solution is grasped.</td>
    </td>
    </tr>

</table>

<h3>Collaboration versus Plagiarism</h3>

You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates and ask questions of the
instructor or consult any source for homework and out-of-class writing
exercises.  You must work hard to avoid plagiarism, which is presenting someone
else's ideas or work as your own.  <b>The work you submit must be your own.</b> Your
writing must be your own voice and your own understanding.  You must use proper
academic citation for any material created by others.  Plagiarism is a serious
academic offense; penalties range from failing the course to expulsion from the
college.

<h3>Honor Policy</h3>

It is expected that each student in this class will conduct him or herself with
academic integrity.  Instances of academic dishonesty will be pursued as
described in the College Catalog and Student Handbook.
