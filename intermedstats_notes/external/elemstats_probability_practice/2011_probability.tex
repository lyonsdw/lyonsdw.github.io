\begin{enumerate}

\item In a family of four children, what is more likely:  two boys and
two girls, or three of one gender and one of the other?

\item A box contains five letters A, B, C, D, and E, all equally likely
to be drawn at random.  Two draws are made at random with replacement.
(Drawing ``with replacement'' means that after the first draw, the item
drawn in replaced and the box is reshuffled, so that all the letters
have the same chance of being drawn on the second draw as they did on
the first.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the two letters drawn are different.
\item Find the probability that at least one of the letters drawn is a vowel.
\item Work the same probability problems as in parts (a) and (b) where
the two draws are taken {\em without} replacement.  (``Without
replacement'' means that the first item is {\em not} placed back in the
box after the first draw.)
\end{enumerate}

\item Four cards are dealt from a well-shuffled, standard 52 card deck.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that none of the cards are diamonds.
\item Find the probability that all four cards are diamonds.
\item Find the probability that all four cards are the same suit.
\end{enumerate}

\item A box contains 1 red and 5 green marbles; each marble is equally
likely to be selected on a random draw from the box.  You draw four
marbles from the box at random.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that a red appears exactly three times if the
draws are made with replacement.
\item Find the probability that a red appears exactly three times if the
draws are made without replacement.
\end{enumerate}

\item  Let $S$ be the sample space of all
possible outcomes for the experiment which is making 5 random draws,
with replacement, from a jar containing 2 red marbles, 3 green marbles
and 4 blue marbles.  For each individual draw, all marbles have the same
chance of being selected.  Outcomes in $S$ are strings of 5 letters using the letters
R, G and B, where the order counts.  For example, the outcome RGGBR
indicates draws of red, green, green, blue, and red marbles, in that
order.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  How many outcomes are in $S$?
\item  Let $E$ be the event ``draw exactly 2 reds in 5 draws.''  How
many outcomes are in $E$?
\item  Is $P(E)$ equal to the number you found in (b) divided by the
number you found in (a)?  Why or why not?  And if not, find $P(E)$.  Give
$P(E)$ as a decimal approximation correct to 3 significant digits.
\item  Let $F$ be the event ``draw exactly 2 blues in 5 draws.''  Are $E$
and $F$ independent?  Show your calculations to support your answer.  Give
$P(F)$ and $P(E \cap F)$ as decimal approximations correct to 3
significant digits.
\end{enumerate}

\item  A fair coin is flipped 100 times.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose you know that at least 99 of the flips are tails.
What are the chances that all 100 are tails?
\item Suppose you know that the first 99 tosses are tails.  What
are the chances that all 100 are tails?
\end{enumerate}

\item You play a lottery where you win if you correctly predict the six
numbers that will be randomly chosen (without replacement) from the
numbers 1--36.  What are your chances of winning?

\item Four cards are dealt face down from a well-shuffled, standard 52
card deck.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the first two cards are red and the second two cards black.
\item Find the probability that exactly two of the cards are red.
\end{enumerate}

\item 100 marbles are in a box; 54 are red, 46 are blue.  Each marble
has the same chance of being selected on a random draw from the box.
Let $E$ be the event ``get exactly 3 reds in 5 random draws with
replacement,'' and let $F$ be the event ``get a red on the first and
last of 5 random draws with replacement.''
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find $P(E)$.
\item Find $P(F)$.
\item Are $E$ and $F$ dependent or independent?
\end{enumerate}


\item  A fair die is rolled 5 times.  Give the probabilities for each of
the following events as a decimal approximation correct to 3 significant
digits.
\begin{enumerate}
         \item All rolls have an even number of spots.
         \item It is not the case that all rolls have an even number of
         spots.
         \item All rolls have an odd number of spots.
          \item Exactly 3 of the rolls show an even number of spots.
\end{enumerate}

\item Given $\Omega=\{a,b,c,d\}$, with $p(a)=1/2$ and $p(b)=1/4$.  Find
$p(c)$ and $p(d)$ if events $E=\{a,c\}$ and $F=\{c,d\}$ are independent.

\item  Two cards are dealt from a well-shuffled standard 52-card deck.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that either both cards are black or both
          cards are hearts?
\item What is the probability that either
          both cards are black or both cards are aces?
\end{enumerate}

\item A card is drawn at random from a well-shuffled standard 52 card
deck, replaced, then the deck is reshuffled.    Imagine this
procedure is repeated N times. What is the smallest value of N for which
there is a 70\% or better chance that a king was drawn at least once?


\item A sample space $S$ consists of 3 outcomes $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Events $U$ and $V$ in $S$ are given by $U=\{a,b\}$ and $V=\{b,c\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose the 3 outcomes are equally likely.  Are $U$ and $V$
dependent or independent?  Explain.
\item If $p(a)=1/2$, find values for $p(b)$ and $p(c)$ so that $U$ and
$V$ are independent, or explain why this cannot be done.
\item If possible, give a complete list of events in $S$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Independent events $E$ and $F$ in a sample space $\Omega$ have
probabilities $P(E)=2/3$ and $P(F)=1/3$.
Find the probability of the event $E \cup F$, or say why there is not
enough information.

\item A fair coin is flipped ten times.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Which is more likely: (i) getting at least one head in the first
five flips or (ii) getting at least two heads in all ten flips?  Show
your work.
\item Find the probability of getting exactly two heads on the first
five flips and exactly four heads on the last five flips.  Give a
decimal approximation correct to three significant digits.
\end{enumerate}

\item Five cards are dealt face down from a well shuffled standard 52
card deck.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that all the cards are red.
\item Find the probability that the cards are, in order, the ace, king,
queen, jack and ten of diamonds.
\item Find the probability that the five cards are the ace, king, queen,
jack and ten of diamonds, in any order.
\end{enumerate}

\item A fair coin is tossed 10 times.  Find the probability that exactly
3 of the first five tosses are heads, while at least 1 of the last five
tosses is a head.  Calculate and give the probability as a decimal
approximation correct to 2 decimal places.
