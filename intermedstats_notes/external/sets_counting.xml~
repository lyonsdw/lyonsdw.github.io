Sets and Counting
</title>

<introduction>
  <p><em>Counting</em> refers to a set of techniques for determining
    relationships between the sizes of sets. Formally, we say
    that sets <m>S,T</m> have the same <em>size</em>,
    or <em>cardinality</em>, if there exists a one-to-one
    correspondence <m>S\leftrightarrow T</m>. We write <m>|S|</m> 
    to denote the number of elements in a finite set <m>S</m>.
  </p>
</introduction>

<subsection>
  <title>Addition Principle(s)</title>

  <p>Recall that two sets are disjoint if their intersection is
  empty. The most basic counting principle is the following.
  </p>

  <proposition>
    <title>Addition Principle</title>
<statement><p>    Let <m>A,B</m> be disjoint finite sets. We have
    <men> |A\cup B| = |A| + |B|.</men></p></statement>
  </proposition>

  <p>A collection of sets is called <em>pairwise disjoint</em>
    if every pair of distinct sets in the collection is disjoint.
    Recall that a partition of a set <m>S</m> is a collection of
    pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets of <m>S</m>
    whose union is all of <m>S</m>. Partitions are a natural context for
    the following generalization of the Addition Principle.
  </p>

  <proposition>
    <title>Addition Principle for Partitions</title>
<statement><p>    Let <m>S</m> be a finite set, and let <m>\mathcal{A}</m> be a
    partition of <m>S</m>. We have
    <men> |S| = \sum_{A\in \mathcal{A}} |A|.</men>
</p></statement>
  </proposition>

<subsection><title>Multiplication Principle(s)</title>

  <p>Multiplication principles are based on the following bit of common
  sense. Suppose your job is to count the chairs in a large dining
  room. Suppose you see right away that the chairs are set around
    tables, and each table has <m>m</m>
     chairs. Do you now count all the chairs
    individually? Of course not. You count the tables: let's say there
    are <m>n</m> of them. Now you know the number of chairs
  is <m>mn</m>, without having counted the chairs one by one. Here is
  the mathematical version of this idea.
  </p>

    <proposition xml:id="partmultprin">
    <title>Multiplication Principle for Partitions</title>
    <statement><p>
	Suppose a finite set <m>S</m> is partitioned into <m>n</m>
	subsets, each of which has the same size <m>m</m>. Then
	<me>|S|=mn.</me>
      </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

		     <p>Let <m>U_1,U_2,\ldots,U_n</m> be a partition

		       for <m>1\leq k\leq n</m>. We have
		       <me>|S|=\sum_{k=1}^n |U_k| = \sum_{k=1}^n n =
			 nm</me>
		       where the first equality is the addition rule for partitions.

</aside>

    <p><xref ref="partmultprin"/> provides a way to count the elements in
    a set using a sequence of <em>decisions</em>, or <em>choices</em>. If a set <m>S</m>
    is partitioned into subsets of equal size, we can choose an element
    of <m>S</m> as follows.
    <ol>
      <li>First, choose one of the partition subsets.</li>
      <li>Second, choose an element from that subset.</li>      
    </ol>
    Since there are <m>n</m> ways to make the first choice, and then,
    having made the first choice, there
    are <m>m</m> ways to make the second choice, then we conclude
    that <m>|S|=mn</m>.
    This thinking generalizes to longer choice sequences, as follows.
  </p>

  <proposition>
    <title>Multiplication Principle for a Sequence of Decisions</title>
<statement>    <p>Suppose that every element of a finite set <m>S</m> is uniquely
      specified by a sequence of <m>t</m>
      choices, such that there are <m>m_1</m>
      ways to make the first choice; then, having made the first choice,
      there are <m>m_2</m> ways to make the second choice (no matter how
      the first choice was made); and so on;
      finally, having made the <m>(t-1)</m>-st choice, there
      are <m>m_t</m> ways to make the <m>t</m>-th choice (no matter how
      the previous choices were made). Then we have
      <men>|S|=m_1m_2\cdots m_t.</men>
       </p>
  </statement>
  </proposition>

  <exercise xml:id="sizeofcartprodexer">  <p>Use the multiplication principle to show that
      <m>|S\times T| = |S|\cdot |T|</m> for finite sets <m>S,T</m>.

  <p>
    Consider the partition <m>\{U_s\colon s\in S\}</m> of <m>S\times
      T</m> given by
    <me>U_s = \{(s,t)\colon t\in T\}=\pi_1^{-1}(s)</me>
    for <m>s\in S</m>, where <m>\pi_1\colon S\times T\to S</m> is given
    by <m>(s,t)\to s</m>. It is clear that the number of elements in the
    partition is <m>|S|</m>, and the size of each element <m>U_s</m>
    of the
    partition is <m>|U_s|=|T|</m>.
  </p>
</aside>

  
  <p>As an application of the Multiplication Principle, we count the number of orderings of a finite
    set. Recall that a bijection is a function that is one-to-one and
    onto. An <em>ordering</em> or <em>permutation</em>
    of a finite set <m>A</m> of
    size <m>|A|=n</m> is given by a
    bijection <m>f\colon \{1,2,\ldots,n\}\to A</m>. We say the first
    element of <m>A</m> is <m>f(1)</m>, the second element
    is <m>f(2)</m>, and so on. We can specify an ordering of <m>A</m> by
    making the following sequence of choices.
    <ol>
      <li>First, choose a value for <m>f(1)</m>. There are <m>n</m> ways
      to make this choice.
      </li>
      <li>Second, choose a value for <m>f(2)</m>. There
	are <m>n-1</m> ways to make this choice from the elements
	in <m>A</m> that were not chosen in step 1.
      </li>
      <li>And so on, for <m>f(3),f(4),\ldots,f(n-1),f(n)</m>, for which
	there are <m>n-2,n-3,\ldots,2,1</m> ways to make each of these
	choices, respectively.
      </li>      
    </ol>
    From this sequence of <m>n</m> choices, we conclude that the number
    of orderings of <m>A</m> is <m>n!= n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots 3\cdot 2\cdot
    1</m>. We record this result as a proposition.

  <title>Sequences and Permutations</title>
  
  <p>Let <m>S</m> be a set. A function <m>f\colon \{1,2,\ldots,r\}\to
      S</m> is called a <em>sequence</em> in <m>S</m> of
      length <m>r</m>. A sequence is denoted by an ordered
      list <m>(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_r)</m> of elements in <m>S</m>,
      where <m>s_k=f(k)</m> for <m>1\leq k\leq r</m>.  The set of all
      possible sequences in <m>S</m> of length <m>r</m> is denoted

      k\leq r\}</men>
    Elements of <m>S^r</m> are also

    name for the subset of sequences <m>f\colon \{1,2,\ldots,r\}\to

    which <m>s_i\neq s_j</m> for <m>i\neq j</m>. These sequences are

  <p>
For <xref ref="cartprodsize"/>, apply the formula in
<xref ref="sizeofcartprodexer"/> in the inductive step of a proof by
induction on <m>r</m>. For <xref ref="permnrformula"/>, apply the
multiplication principle for a sequence of choices: to specify a
permutation of <m>r</m> elements of <m>S</m>, first choose some element
of <m>S</m>. There are <m>|S|</m> ways to make this decision. Having
made this choice, now choose a second element from the
remaining <m>|S|-1</m> elements of <m>S</m>. And so on, until you choose
an <m>r</m>th element of <m>S</m>, for which there are <m>|S|-r+1</m>
elements remaining to choose from. Alternatively, consider making a
sequence of two decisions to choose an ordering of all the elements
in <m>S</m>. First, choose a permutation of length <m>r</m> (there
are <m>|P_r(S)|</m> ways to make this choice), then choose an ordering
of the remaining <m>|S|-r</m> elements of <m>S</m> (there
are <m>(|S|-r)!)</m> ways to make this choice). The multiplication rule
says that <m>|S|! = |P_r(S)|\cdot (|S|-r)!</m>. Rearranging gives the
desired result.

      all subsets of <m>S</m> of size <m>r</m>. The sets 
<m>C_r(S)</m> and <m>P_r(S)</m> are related: An element

	    The number of subsets of size <m>r</m> in a set of
