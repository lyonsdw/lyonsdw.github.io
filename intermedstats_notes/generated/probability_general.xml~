  General Probability Models
</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    In general, a probability model is a pair <m>(\Omega,P)</m>,
    where <m>\Omega</m> is a set, and where <m>P</m> is a function on
    a <em>subset</em> of the power set of <m>\Omega</m>. What all
    probability models have in common are the vocabulary
    (<xref ref="finprobmodelvocabdef"/>) and properties
    (<xref ref="probprops"/>) that you have already seen for finite
    probability models in the previous section. We begin with a
    generalization of the finite probability model.

<subsection>
  <title>Discrete Probability Models</title>

  <p>The definitions (<xref ref="finprobfndef"/>,
  <xref ref="finprobmeasdef"/>, <xref ref="finiteprobmodeldef"/>) for a
  finite probability model generalize naturally for
  countably infinite probability spaces. The only
  necessary change is to replace the word <q>finite</q> with the
  phrase <q>finite or countably infinite</q>.  Together, finite
  probability models and their countably infinite generalizations are
  called <em>discrete probability models</em>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <p>A <em>probability function</em> on a finite or countably
	infinite set <m>\Omega</m> is a function <m>p\colon \Omega\to
	[0,1]</m> that
	satisfies <m>\sum_{\omega\in\Omega}p(\omega)=1</m>. A <em>discrete
	  probability measure</em> on a finite or countably infinite
	space <m>\Omega</m> is a function <m>P\colon \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\to
	  [0,1]</m> given by <m>P(E)=\sum_{e\in E}p(e)</m> for <m>E\subseteq
	  \Omega</m>, where <m>p</m> is a probability function
	on <m>\Omega</m>. A <term>discrete probability model</term> is a
	pair <m>(\Omega,P)</m>, where <m>\Omega</m>
	is a finite or
	countably infinite set, and where <m>P</m> is a discrete
	probability measure on <m>\Omega</m>.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <exercise>
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Show that the definition of the probability
	  space <m>\Omega^n</m> (see <xref ref="finiterandsampsect"/>)
	  works for countably infinite descrete
	  models <m>(\Omega,P)</m>.
	  </li>
	  <li>Do simple random samples make sense for infinite
	  probability spaces?</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
    </exercise>

    <p><alert>Example.</alert> Let <m>\Omega=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}</m>, and
	  let <m>p\colon \Omega\to [0,1]</m> given by <m>p(n)=1/2^n</m>.
    </p>

    <exercise><p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Show that <m>p</m> is a probability function.</li>
	  <li>Find the probability of the event <m>E=\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}</m>. 
	  </li>
	  <li>Find the probability of the event <m>F=\{5k\colon k=1,2,3,\ldots\}</m>.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </p>
    </exercise>

    <p><alert>Samples from probability models.</alert> For a discrete
      probability model <m>(\Omega,P)</m> with probability
      function <m>p</m>, we define the probability space of <term>samples of
	size <m>n</m></term> from <m>\Omega</m> to be the
      space <m>\Omega^n</m> with probability function <m>p_{\Omega^n}</m>
      defined by <xref ref="randsampprobfn"/>. 
    </p>

    <exercise><p>Show that the function <m>p_{\Omega^n}</m> is indeed a
    probability function.
      </p>
    </exercise>
    
</subsection>

<subsection>
  <title>Uncountable probability spaces</title>

  <p>For an uncountable set <m>\Omega</m>, it is impossible to have a
    probability function. That is, there does not exist any
    function <m>p\colon \Omega \to [0,1]</m> that
    satisfies <m>\sum_{\omega\in \Omega}p(\omega)=1</m>. Nevertheless,
    it is possible to define a probability measure in a way that
    satisfies all of the properties in <xref ref="probprops"/>
    by restricting the set of events to a proper <em>subset</em> of the
    power set <m>\mathcal{P}(\Omega)</m>. In these notes, we will omit
    the technical details for how this is done. Instead we will
    illustrate with two examples.
  </p>

  <exercise><p>Why not? Why is it impossible to have a probability
  function on an uncountable set?</p>
  </exercise>

  <p><alert>Uniform probability measures.</alert> Let <m>\Omega</m> be
  the set of points inside of a geometric figure with a finite area or volume, say, a two-dimensional
    figure with area equal to <m>A</m> square units. Given any
    rectangle <m>R\subset\Omega</m>, define <m>P(R)</m> to be
    <men xml:id="unifprobmeas">P(R)=\frac{\text{area of }R}{A}.</men> This probability measure
    is <em>uniform</em> in the sense that it doesn't matter
    where <m>R</m> is located with <m>\Omega</m>. The probability
    of <m>R</m> is completely determined by its area. Similarly, the
    uniform probability measure on an interval <m>\Omega=[a,b]</m> of real
    numbers is given by <m>P([c,d]) = \frac{c-d}{b-a}</m> for any
    interval <m>[c,d]\subseteq \Omega</m>.

  </p>
  
  <p><alert>Infinite sequences of coin tosses</alert> Let <m>\Omega</m>
    be the set of infinite sequences of tosses of a fair
    coin. For <m>(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3,\ldots)\in \Omega</m>, each entry <m>\omega_k</m> 
    is one of the two outcomes in the probability
    space <m>C=\{H,T\}</m> (<m>C</m> is for <q>coin</q>, <m>H</m> is
    for <q>heads</q>, and <m>T</m> is for <q>tails</q>) with probability
    function <m>p(H)=p(T)=1/2</m>. Now suppose that <m>E\subseteq
    C^n</m>, so that <m>P_{C^n}(E)=|E|/2^n</m> (see
    <xref ref="randsampprobfn"/>). Let <m>E'</m> is the subset
    of <m>\Omega</m> defined by
    <me>E'=\{(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3,\ldots)\in \Omega\colon
      (\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots,\omega_n)\in E\}.</me>
    If it is possible to define a probability measure <m>P_{\Omega}</m>,
      then intuition demands 
    that we must have <men xml:id="infseqcointossmeas">P_{\Omega}(E')=P_{C^n}(E).</men> In fact it turns
      out that such a probability measure exists. We will not give the
      full details for how it is constructed. Happily, it turns out that
      <xref ref="infseqcointossmeas"/> give us what we need to work with
      the probability space <m>(\Omega,P_{\Omega})</m>.
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <p>Explain why <m>\Omega</m> is uncountable. Explain why
      there can be no probability function on <m>\Omega^\infty</m>. Find
      the probability that the first head in an infinite sequence of tosses occurs
      on toss number 5. Example of a nonmeasureable set?
    </p>
  </exercise>

      <p><alert>Samples from uncountable probability models.</alert> For
      an uncountable probability model <m>(\Omega,P)</m>, we define the probability space of <term>samples of
	size <m>n</m></term> from <m>\Omega</m> to be the
      space <m>\Omega^n</m> with probability measure <m>P_{\Omega^n}</m>
	defined by
	<men>P_{\Omega^n}(E_1\times E_2\times \cdots \times E_n) =
	  P(E_1)P(E_2)\cdots P(E_n)</men>
	where <m>E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_n</m> are events in <m>\Omega</m>.
    </p>

      <exercise><p>Check one or more properties of probability for one
	  or more special cases for <m>P_{\Omega^n}</m>.
