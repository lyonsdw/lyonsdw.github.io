<subsection><title>Intuition for probability definitions</title>

  <p>When we say <q>game of chance</q>
    or <q>chance process</q>, we imagine some
  kind of orderly procedure (for example: flipping coins, rolling dice, drawing
  lottery tickets, etc.) that produces an outcome that we cannot predict
    with certainty. In the face of uncertainty, we do the next best
  thing, which is to assign likelihood. For example, we don't know for
  certain in advance whether a roll of a fair die will land showing the
  6 face, or whether the die will land showing a face with an even or an
  odd number. But
    we can predict that the 6 face outcome will occur in
  about <m>1/6\approx 16.7\%</m> of many rolls, and that a roll
  will show a face with an odd number in about half of many rolls. This is what we
  mean when we say <q>the probability that a roll of a fair die comes up 6
      is <m>1/6</m></q>, and <q>the probability that a fair dies comes up odd
      is <m>1/2</m></q>.
  </p>

  <p>This simple example introduces the three components of the
    mathematical definition of probability. For a roll of a fair die, there is a <em>set of
      outcomes</em>
    <m>\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>. Subsets of <m>\Omega</m> are
    called <em>events</em>. For example, the sets
    <m>A=\{6\}</m>
    and  <m>B=\{1,3,5\}</m> the <em>events</em>
    described in words by  <m>A=\text{"roll a 6"}</m> and <m>B=\text{"roll an odd number"}</m>, respectively. The probabilities
    <m>P(A)=1/6</m> and <m>P(B)=1/2</m> are assignments given to events
    by a function <m>P</m> called a
    <em>probability measure</em>. The subsection that follow give the
    complete formal definition of a probability space.</p>

  <title>Algebras of sets</title>

  <p>We begin with some definitions from set theory.</p>

  <definition><title>Power set of a set</title>
<p>    Let <m>X</m> be a set. The <term>power set</term> of <m>X</m>,
    denoted <m>\mathcal{P}(X)</m>, is the set of all subsets
    of <m>X</m>. In symbols,
  <me>\mathcal{P}(X) = \{A\colon A\subseteq X\}.</me></p>
  </definition>
  
  <definition><title>Algebra of subsets of a set</title>
<p>    Let <m>X</m> be a set and let <m>\mathcal{A}\subseteq
      \mathcal{P}(X)</m>, that is, <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is a set of
  subsets of <m>X</m>. We say that <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is
  an <term>algebra of subsets</term> of <m>X</m> if the following
  conditions hold.
  <mdn>
    <mrow>X\in \mathcal{A}
    </mrow>
    <mrow xml:id="complementclosure">\text{if } A\in \mathcal{A}, \text{ then }(X \setminus A)\in
	\mathcal{A} 
    </mrow>
    <mrow xml:id="unionclosure">\text{if }A,B \in \mathcal{A}, 
    \text{ then }(A\cup B)\in \mathcal{A}
    </mrow>
  </mdn></p>
  </definition>

  <exercise xml:id="intersectionclosure">
    <p>Let <m>\mathcal{A}</m> be an algebra of subsets of a
	set <m>X</m>. Show that <m>\emptyset\in \mathcal{A}</m> and that
	if <m>A,B</m> are elements of <m>\mathcal{A}</m>, then 
       <m>(A\cap B)\in \mathcal{A}</m>.
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <p>Show that the power set <m>\mathcal{P}(X)</m> of a set <m>X</m>
      is an algebra of subsets of <m>X</m>.
    </p>
  </exercise>

  <p>
  <alert>Terminology:</alert> We express condition in words
    <xref ref="complementclosure"/> by saying that an algebra of sets is 
    <em>closed under complementation</em>. Condition
  <xref ref="unionclosure"/> is expressed
  by saying that an algebra of sets is <em>closed under
  unions</em>. <xref ref="intersectionclosure"/> says that an algebra of
  sets is <em>closed under intersections</em>.
</p>

  <!--
  <p>comments, replace closure under finite unions by closure under
  countable unions</p>
  
  <definition><title><m>\sigma</m>-algebra of subsets of a set</title>
<p>    Let <m>X</m> be a set and let <m>\mathcal{A}\subseteq
      \mathcal{P}(X)</m>, that is, <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is a set of
  subsets of <m>X</m>. We say that <m>\mathcal{A}</m> is
  a <term><m>\sigma</m>-algebra of subsets</term> of <m>X</m> if the following
  conditions hold.
  <mdn>
    <mrow>X\in \mathcal{A}
    </mrow>
    <mrow >\text{if } A\in \mathcal{A}, \text{ then }(X \setminus A)\in
	\mathcal{A} 
    </mrow>
    <mrow xml:id="countableunionclosure">\text{if }A_n \in
    \mathcal{A}\text{ for } n\in \N, 
    \text{ then }(\bigcup_n A_n)\in \mathcal{A}
    </mrow>
  </mdn></p>
  </definition>
  
  <p>put an exercise here to see that closure under countable unions
  does not follow from closure under finite unions, and give an example
    of a <m>\sigma</m>-algebra of sets

<subsection><title>Probability Spaces</title>

  <p>disclaimer needed, some comment about finite versus infinite
  outcome spaces</p>
  
  <definition>
    <p>A <term>finite probability space</term> is a
  triple <m>(\Omega,\mathcal{E},P)</m>, where 
    <m>\Omega</m> is a set, <m>\mathcal{E}</m> is a finite algebra of subsets of <m>\Omega</m>, 
and <m>P</m> is a function <m>P\colon \mathcal{E}\to
      [0,1]</m> that satisfies the following properties.
  <mdn>
    <mrow>P(\Omega)=1
    </mrow>
    <mrow>\text{if }A,B \in \mathcal{E}\text{ and } A\cap B=\emptyset, \text { then } P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)
    </mrow>
  </mdn>
    </p>
  <p>
  Elements of <m>\Omega</m> are called <term>outcomes</term>. Elements
  of <m>\mathcal{E}</m> are called <term>events</term>, and <m>P</m> is
  called a <term>probability measure</term>. 
</p>    
</definition>



  <p><alert>Notes on terminology:</alert> In the same way that we refer
    to a function <m>f\colon X\to Y</m> simply by the
    name <q><m>f</m></q>, we often refer to the probability
    space <m>(\Omega,\mathcal{E},P)</m> simply by the name <q><m>\Omega</m></q>.
    In words, the condition

    <fn>If <m>\mathcal{E}</m> is infinite, then a stronger version
  </fn>
    </p>

  <p><alert>Comment on the general definition of probability:</alert> To
    define a probability space without the qualifying
    adjective <q>finite</q>, it is necessary to replace condition
    <xref ref="unionclosure"/> by a the following:
hmm this needs work
