\section{Probability}\label{probability}

The theory of probability was developed to analyze processes involving
chance.  In this section we give the basic vocabulary, properties, and
examples of the simplest type of the probability model, called a {\em
finite discrete probability space}.  The general case of infinite
probability spaces is much more technical.  However, it is fair to say
that many aspects of the general case are approximated by large finite
probability spaces.

\subsubsection*{Notation preliminaries}

In the definitions below, we use the Greek letter capital omega
$\Omega$ as the name of a finite set.  We use lower case omega
$\omega$ to denote an element in $\Omega$.  Given a finite set $S$
consisting of distinct elements $s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N$, and a function
$f\colon S\to \R$, we write $\displaystyle \sum_{s\in S} f(s)$ to denote
the sum $f(s_1)+f(s_2) + \ldots + f(s_N)$.

\subsection{Probability function and probability space}

A function $P\colon \Omega\to \R$ on a finite set $\Omega$ is called a
{\bfit probability function} if it satisfies the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}
\item [(i)] $P(\omega)\geq 0$ for all $\omega$ in $\Omega$
\item [(ii)] $\displaystyle \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} P(\omega) = 1$
\end{enumerate}
The set $\Omega$ is called the {\bfit probability space} or {\bfit sample
space} of the probability function $P$.  Elements of $\Omega$ are called
{\bfit outcomes} and subsets of $\Omega$ are called {\bfit events}.
Given an event $E$, we define the {\bfit probability of $E$}, denoted
$P(E)$, to be the sum
$$P(E)=\sum_{\omega \in E} P(\omega).$$ We define the probability of the
empty set to be zero.  Given a single outcome $\omega$, we call
$P(\omega)=P(\{\omega\})$ the {\bfit probability of $\omega$}.
If $P$ is a
constant function given by $P(\omega)=1/N$ for all $\omega$, where $N$
is the number of elements in $\Omega$, we say $P$ is a {\bfit
uniform} probability function.

\begin{rem}
{Examples}{boxmodeleg}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Tossing a fair coin is modeled by the probability space $\Omega
= \{H,T\}$ with probability function $p$ given by $P(H)=P(T)=1/2$.

\item A single roll of a fair die is modeled by the probability space
$\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ with the uniform probability distribution
$p(\omega)=1/6$ for all six outcomes.

\item A gambling game in which your chance of winning is 25\% is modeled
by the probability space $\Omega=\{W,L\}$ with $P(W)=.25$ and $P(L)=.75$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{rem}

Given events $E$ and $F$ in a probability space $\Omega$, we refer to the intersection $E\cap
F$ as the event ``$E$ and $F$,'' and refer to the union $E\cup F$ as the
event ``$E$ or $F$,'' where ``or'' has the meaning ``one or the other
or both.''  The event $\Omega\setminus E
= \{\omega \in \Omega\colon \omega\not\in E\}$, also denoted $E^c$, is called the {\bfit
complement} or {\bfit opposite} of $E$.
Two events that have no outcomes in common (that is, subsets of the
sample space whose intersection is the empty set) are called {\bfit
disjoint} or {\bfit mutually exclusive}.  

\begin{rem}
{Example}{andoreg}  
In example~2 above
that models a single roll of a fair die.  Let $E=\{2,4,6\}$ be the event
``roll an even number'' and $F=\{4,5,6\}$ be the event ``roll a number
greater than 3.''  Then the event ``$E$ and $F$'' is the set $E\cap
F=\{4,6\}$.  In words, this is the set of all rolls that fit the
description ``roll an even number that is also greater than 3.''  The
event ``$E$ or $F$'' is the set $E\cup F=\{2,4,5,6\}$.  The is the set
of all rolls that fit the description ``roll an even {\em or} roll a
number greater than 3.''  The opposite of $E$ is the event $\{1,3,5\}$
described by the phrase ``roll an odd number.''
\end{rem}

\subsection{The Addition Rule}

Given events $E$ and $F$ in a sample space $\Omega$, regrouping the
terms in the sum
$$P(E) + P(F) = \sum_{\omega \in E} P(\omega) + \sum_{\omega \in F}
P(\omega)$$
yields the sum
$$\sum_{\omega \in E\cup F} + \sum_{\omega \in E\cap F}=P(E\cup F) +
P(E\cap F).$$
Solving for $P(E\cup F)$ gives the {\bfit union rule}, also called the
{\bfit sum rule} or {\bfit addition rule}.
\begin{equation}
\label{unionrule}
P(E\cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E\cap F)
\end{equation}
When $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive, that is, when $E\cap F$ is
empty, the union rule takes on a simpler form, sometimes called the {\em
sum rule} or {\em addition rule} for mutually exclusive events.
\begin{equation}
\label{sumrule}
P(E\cup F) = P(E) + P(F) \hspace*{.1in} \mbox{($E$, $F$
mutually exclusive)}
\end{equation}
When $F=E^c$, we have $E\cup F=\Omega$ and the sum rule yields
\begin{equation}
1 = P(S) = P(E\cup E^c) = P(E) + P(E^c).
\end{equation}
Rearranging by solving for $P(E)$, we get a formula called the {\bfit complement
rule} or {\bfit opposite rule}.
\begin{equation}
\label{complementrule}
P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)
\end{equation}
In words, the opposite rule says that the probability of an event equals
one hundred percent minus the probability of the opposite event.  This
rule is useful because sometimes $P(E^c)$ is easier to determine
than $P(E)$.  See example~2 in~\ref{egprobs} below.

\subsection{Conditional Probability and Multiplication Rule}

Let $E$ and $F$ be two events in a sample space $\Omega$, with $P(F)\neq
0$.
The {\bfit conditional probability of $E$ given $F$}, denoted $P(E|F)$, is
defined to be
\begin{equation}
\label{condprobdef}
P(E|F) = \frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(F)}.
\end{equation}
Conditional probability has the following meaning.  Suppose it is known
that event $F$ has occurred in the game of chance modeled by $\Omega$,
and we wish to assess the probability that the selected outcome belongs
to the set $E$.  In effect, the knowledge that the given outcome lies in
$F$ allows us to reduce the sample space from $\Omega$ to $F$.  We
replace $P\colon \Omega \to \R$ by $P'\colon F\to \R$ given by
$P'(\omega) = P(\omega)/P(F)$.  We ignore all the outcomes in $E$ that
don't belong to $F$, which means that we replace $E$ by $E\cap F$ and
calculate the ``new'' probability of $E$ as $\frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(F)}$.
In words, $P(E|F)$ is the probability that the event $E$ occurs {\bfit
given that} the event $F$ has occurred.

A rearrangement of~(\ref{condprobdef}) is called the {\bfit multiplication
rule}. Given events $E,F$ with $P(F)\neq 0$, we have
\begin{equation} 
\label{multrule}
P(E\cap F) = P(E|F)P(F).
\end{equation}
In words, the multiplication rule says that the probability that events
$E$ and $F$ both happen is equal to the probability that $E$ happens
given that $F$ has happened, times the probability that $F$ happens.
This rule is useful because it gives us a way to calculate $P(E\cap F)$,
which is often complicated, in terms of $P(E|F)$ and $P(F)$, which are
often simpler.

\begin{rem}
{Example}{condprobeg} Problem: Two cards are dealt from a well-shuffled
standard 52 card deck.  What is the probability that both cards are red?

Comment: When we use the multiplication rule~(\ref{multrule}) we think
of $F$ as ``happening first'' and work out the right hand side from
right to left.  Here is the solution for this example.

Solution: The probability we wish to find is the probability that the
first card is red and the second card is red.  Working on the right hand
side of~(\ref{multrule}) from right to left, let $F$ be the event
``first card is red'' and $E$ be the event ``second card is red.'' It is
easy to see that $P(F) = 1/2$ (there are 26 red cards in the 52 card
deck; each card has the same chance of being drawn first) and that
$P(E|F) = 25/51$ (once $F$ has happened, there are 51 cards left, 25 of
which are red; each of the 51 cards has the same chance of being drawn
next).  Therefore, the multiplication rule gives us
$$P(E\cap F) = 1/2 \cdot 25/51 = 25/102.$$
\end{rem}

\subsection{Independence and Dependence}

Two events $E,F$ are called {\bfit independent} if 
\begin{equation}\label{indepdefn}
P(E\cap F)=P(E)P(F)
\end{equation}
and are called {\bfit dependent} otherwise.  
If $P(F)\neq 0$, dividing both sides of~(\ref{indepdefn}) by $P(F)$ yields
$P(E|F)=P(E)$.  The intuitive practical interpretation
of the equation $P(E|F)=P(E)$ is that the likelihood of $E$ occurring
does not depend on knowledge that $F$ has occurred.
Conversely, if the likelihood of $E$ occurring {\em does} depend on
knowledge that $F$ has occurred, that is, if $P(E|F)\neq P(E)$, then
$E,F$ are dependent.  

We use equation~(\ref{indepdefn}) in two distinct ways: as the {\em
definition} of independence for two events; and as a {\em formula} where
we use the right hand side to find the unknown probability on the left
hand side when $E,F$ are known to be independent.  In the latter case,
we think of~(\ref{indepdefn}) as a special case of the multiplication
rule~(\ref{multrule}).

\begin{rem}
{Examples}{indepdepeg}
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Using~(\ref{indepdefn}) as a formula for an unknown probability)
What is the chance that a fair coin comes up heads in two 
consecutive tosses?  It is intuitively clear that the probability that
the second toss comes up heads is $1/2$ whether or not we know that the
first toss comes up heads.  In other words, the events $E=\mbox{``first
toss is heads''}$ and $F=\mbox{``second toss is heads''}$ are
independent.  We use~(\ref{indepdefn}) to get
$$P(E\cap F) = P(E) P(F) = 1/2 \cdot 1/2 = 1/4.$$
\item (Using~(\ref{indepdefn}) as a definition to check independence)
Problem: Let $S$ be a sample space consisting of twelve marbles labeled
by the letters A through L.  Let $U$ be the event consisting of the letters
A through F, let $V$ be the event consisting of the letters D through I,
and let $W$ be the letters H, I, J.  For each pair $U,V$, $U,W$ and
$V,W$, decide if the pair is independent or dependent.

Solution: We have $U\cap V=\{\mbox{D,E,F}\}$, $U\cap W=\emptyset$ and
$V\cap W =\{\mbox{H,I}\}$.  We see that $P(U\cap V)=3/12=1/4$ and
$P(U)P(V) = 1/2\cdot 1/2 = 1/4$, so $U$ and $V$ are independent of one
another.  We have $P(U\cap W) = 0$, whereas $P(U)P(W)$ is certainly not
zero, so $U$ and $W$ are dependent events.  Finally, we have $P(V\cap W)
= 2/12 = 1/6$, but $P(V)P(W) = 1/2\cdot 3/12 = 1/8$, so $V$ and $W$ are
dependent. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{rem}

\subsubsection*{Many independent events}

To say that events in a finite collection ${\cal E}$ are {\bfit
independent} means that the multiplication rule
$$P(E_1\cap E_2\cap \cdots \cap E_k) = P(E_1)P(E_2)\cdots P(E_k)$$
holds for for every subset $\{E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_k\}$ of ${\cal E}$.

The classic example is in a game of many tosses, say $n$, of a fair coin.  Let
$E_i$ be the event ``get a head on toss $i$''.  The events
$E_1,\ldots,E_n$ are independent.

\subsection{Example problems}\label{egprobs}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Three cards are dealt from a well-shuffled, standard 52 card
deck.  Find the probability that all three are diamonds.

Solution: Working from right to left, let $G$ be the event ``first card is a diamond,'' let $F$ be
``second card is a diamond,'' and let $E$ be ``third card is a
diamond.''  We wish to find $P(E\cap F\cap G)$.  Using the
multiplication rule, we have
$$P(E\cap F\cap G) = P(E|(F\cap G)) \cdot P(F\cap G).$$
Using the multiplication rule again, we have
$$P(F\cap G) = P(F|G) \cdot P(G).$$
Putting this together, we get
$$P(E\cap F\cap G) = P(E|(F\cap G)) \cdot P(F|G) \cdot P(G).$$ The
probabilities on the right are easy.  Since there are 13 diamonds in the
deck of 52 cards, we have $P(G) = 13/52 = 1/4$.  If we know the first
card is a diamond, there are 12 diamonds left among 51 cards, so
$P(F|G)=12/51$.  If we know the first and second cards are diamonds,
there are 11 diamonds left among 50 cards, so $P(E|(F\cap G)) = 11/50$.
Putting these together (in reverse order), we get
$$P(E\cap F\cap G) = 13/52 \cdot 12/51 \cdot 11/50.$$

\item A fair die is rolled three times.  Find the probability that one
or more of the rolls are sixes.

Solution: Let $E$ be the event ``one or more of the rolls are sixes.''
Notice that the opposite event $E^c$ is ``none of the rolls are sixes,''
which is the same thing as ``all of the rolls are in the range one
through five.''  Let $A$ be the event ``get a non-six on the first roll,''
let $B$ be ``get a non-six on the second roll,'' and let $C$ be ``get a
non-six on the third roll,'' so that $E^c=A\cap B\cap C$.  Using the
opposite rule, we have
$$P(E) = 1 - P(E^c) = 1 - P(A\cap B\cap C).$$
Since $A$, $B$ and $C$ are independent (the rolls of the die do not know
about or affect one another) we have, 
$$P(A\cap B\cap C) = P(A)P(B)P(C) = 5/6 \cdot 5/6 \cdot 5/6 = (5/6)^3.$$
So we have our solution
$$P(E) = 1 - (5/6)^3.$$

\item In five card poker, a {\em full house} is a collection of five
cards of which three have the same face value and the remaining two have
the same face value, but all five cards do not share the same face
value.  What is the probability that five cards dealt from a
well-shuffled, standard 52 card deck is a full house?

Solution (using counting techniques from \S\ref{counting}): Let
$S$ be the set of all five card hands, and let $E$ be the subset of $S$
which is the set of full houses, so $P(E)=|E|/|S|$.  The size of $S$ is
$|S|={52 \choose 5}$.  To count the size of $E$, we see that we can make
a full house by the following sequence of choices: first, choose a face
value for three cards; second, choose three suits for the three cards;
third, choose a face value for the two remaining cards; last, choose two
suits for the two cards.  Clearly, there are $13$ ways to make the first
choice, ${4 \choose 3}=4$ ways to make the second choice, 12 ways to
make the third choice, and ${4\choose 2}=6$ ways to make the final choice.
Thus we have a total of $13\cdot 12\cdot 4\cdot 6 = 3744$ full houses,
and so $P(E) = 3744/{52\choose 5} \approx 0.144\%$, or about 1 chance in
700. 

\item A sample space consists of 4 outcomes called $a,b,c,d$.  Outcome
$a$ is twice as likely as outcome $b$, and outcomes $b,c,d$ are equally
likely.  What is the probability of outcome $a$?

Solution: We know $P(a) + P(b) + P(c) + P(d) = 1$, that $P(a)
= 2P(b)$, and that $P(b) = P(c) = P(d)$.  Substituting, we get 
$$P(a) + \frac{1}{2}P(a) + \frac{1}{2}P(a) + \frac{1}{2}P(a) = 1.$$
Solving for $P(a)$, we get $P(a) = 2/5$.
