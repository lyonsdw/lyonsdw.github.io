Hypothesis Testing
</title>

<subsection><title>1-tail <m>z</m> test
  </title>

    <p>Hypothesis testing is using sample data to assign numbers for how
    skeptical you should be about certain claims. Here's an example. You
    are assigned to check the accuracy of a machine that is supposed to
    make identical widgets with a weight of <m>\mu_0</m> grams. Your
      sample of <m>n</m>
      widgets has an average weight of <m>\overline{X}</m>
      grams, and your weighings have a sample SD of <m>s</m> grams.
    There is a difference between your sample
    average <m>\overline{X}</m> and <m>\mu_0</m>. How do you decide
    whether the difference is significant? In a hypothesis test, we
    play <q>what-if?</q>, in the following way. We suppose that the
    machine actually performs according to the claimed standards,
    so that the average widget has a weight of <m>\mu_0</m>. Now we ask,
      what is the probability that a random sample of size <m>n</m>
      would be as far away or farther from <m>\mu_0</m>
      as the value <m>\overline{X}</m>
      that we observed? By the Central Limit Theorem, the answer is
      <me>1-\Phi\left(
	\left|\frac{\overline{X}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}\right|\right).</me>
      If this probability is small, we feel skeptical of the claim that
      the machine produced widgets with an average weight
	of <m>\mu_0</m>. If this probability is large, we do not feel
	skeptical. The threshold probability value for skepticism is adjustable. The
      most common default value is <m>0.05</m>. The formal structure of
      this type of hypothesis test, called a <term>1-tail <m>z</m> test</term>
      is this.
      <ol>
	<li>A null hypothesis, denoted <m>H_0</m>, is made. This is a
	  claim that a population average for a certain random
	  variable <m>X</m> has a certain value <m>\mu_0</m>.</li>
	<li>A sample of <m>X</m> is taken.</li>
	<li>A threshhold probability <m>\alpha</m> is chosen.
	</li>
	<li>The test statistic
	  <me>P=1-\Phi\left(
	    \left|\frac{\overline{X}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}\right|\right)</me>
	  is calculated.
	</li>
	<li>A conclusion is made: if <m>P\lt \alpha</m>, the data is
	  called <em>significant</em>. The null hypothesis
	  is <em>rejected</em>. If <m>P\gt \alpha</m>, the data is
	  called <em>not significant</em>. The null hypothesis
	  is <em>not rejected</em>.
	</li>
      </ol>
